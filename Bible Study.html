                                            things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew
                                            God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

                                                Each study will explore the theological insight behind fundamental Christian truth, while also exploring emerging contemporary errors to be aware of. While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                                This series of study is aimed at fortifying every member of TACEF in the foundational principles of Christ, which is the basis to become strong pillars in the great house and impactful agents of revival in our communities. We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

                                                Each study will explore the theological insight behind fundamental Christian truth, while also exploring emerging contemporary errors to be aware of. While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                                it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                                of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                                form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                            What sort of relationship do I have with God? Is God a tool that I use when I have a problem or the eternal Father that my heart longs after with fear and true love? Am I in regular fellowship with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ? Do I listen when
                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

                                            things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                CONTEMPORARY ERRORS

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

                                                (2) God will not give His glory to other competing “gods”, Isaiah 42:8 – I am the LORD, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                This foundation of the knowledge of God must be fortified with fear and love. Fearing and loving God means the recognition that He is holy and awesome, and that we cannot take the relationship we have with Him for granted through sin. In as much as He
                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving

                                            18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 20 For the invisible
                                            things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew
                                            God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed
                                            the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
                                            their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

                                                Each study will explore the theological insight behind fundamental Christian truth, while also exploring emerging contemporary errors to be aware of. While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                                it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                                of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                                form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                This foundation of the knowledge of God must be fortified with fear and love. Fearing and loving God means the recognition that He is holy and awesome, and that we cannot take the relationship we have with Him for granted through sin. In as much as He
                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not

                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

                                                (2) God will not give His glory to other competing “gods”, Isaiah 42:8 – I am the LORD, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                This foundation of the knowledge of God must be fortified with fear and love. Fearing and loving God means the recognition that He is holy and awesome, and that we cannot take the relationship we have with Him for granted through sin. In as much as He
                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                            things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                                (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                                it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                                of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                                form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                This foundation of the knowledge of God must be fortified with fear and love. Fearing and loving God means the recognition that He is holy and awesome, and that we cannot take the relationship we have with Him for granted through sin. In as much as He
                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore

                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

                                                This series of study is aimed at fortifying every member of TACEF in the foundational principles of Christ, which is the basis to become strong pillars in the great house and impactful agents of revival in our communities. We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

                                                Each study will explore the theological insight behind fundamental Christian truth, while also exploring emerging contemporary errors to be aware of. While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

                                            things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew

We live in a time when the realities
                                                of God is fading so fast, as erroneous doctrines and inaccurate truths are being peddled with consequent shipwreck of the faith of many. The coming of the Lord is getting near and the best we need at a time
                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                This first study will help us to better understand who God is as the ultimate foundation of our lives. A man’s journey in God is as good as the knowledge he has of Him. When the foundation of the knowledge of God is missing in a life, such a life will
                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

                                                (2) God will not give His glory to other competing “gods”, Isaiah 42:8 – I am the LORD, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                                it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                                of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                                form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                This foundation of the knowledge of God must be fortified with fear and love. Fearing and loving God means the recognition that He is holy and awesome, and that we cannot take the relationship we have with Him for granted through sin. In as much as He
                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.

                                            He speaks to me? Am I being led by His Spirit in my day-to-day life? Do I stand on God’s Word even in this day and age of deception, delusion, and a self-centred world? Are there any false gods which I have
                                            made first in my heart and life, while relegating the Creator, God Almighty to second place? Am I really serving God for what I will get or because I want to genuinely know Him?

We live in a time when the realities

                                                like this is to be established in the timeless truth of the gospel of Christ. The implication of being rooted in the sure foundation of Christ will determine how far each of us will stand firm till the end.

While some of these teachings may seem familiar, we must have the learning heart of 2 Peter 1 vs 12 “Wherefore
                                                I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”

                                                collapse like packs of cards. The knowledge of God is beyond attending fellowships or keeping a prayer pattern. It is a journey of personal discovery and reality that nothing in this world can take away.

                                                We live in a time when the essence and nature of God is ridiculed with inaccurate understanding of who God is and how He wants to relate with us as His creation. Many have turned God into a servant that they command at will or a spare tyre that is only
                                                needed when the vehicle of their lives have a breakage. This explains why we have so much religious activities and no godliness in our midst. When the general understanding of God lacks solid foundation
                                                in a generation, we will see more of self-seeking (not God-serving), worldly (not heavenly) and sinful (not holy) tendencies.

                                                While we all generally acknowledge the triune nature of God as one God in three individual but united persons (Godhead), we must seek to know God for ourselves at a personal and intimate level. Our understanding of God is the foundation that shields us
                                                from modern day idolatry where modern day “gods” like Music, Fashion, Football, Money, Career etc. can evolve to become a strong influential force shaping our aspirations, desires and basis of existence.

                                                The right foundation in God must be built on the basic knowledge that no other things must stand side-by-side the place of God in our lives. God is not seeking 99.9%. It is either 100% or none. The foundation of our knowledge in God is also sure when
                                                we realise that He is the owner and the one who decides what He wants to make out of our lives because He created us for His own pleasure (Revelation 4:11). My life must always give God pleasure and not
                                                pressure.

                                                It is also important to understand the independence of God. He created all things for his own purposes. Therefore, since He is before all things, and He remains the same before and after creation, He depends upon nothing outside of Himself. God simply
                                                exists in and of Himself. He does not need me to be God. This is why Exodus 3:14 captured Him as “‘I AM THAT I AM”, meaning “I will be what I will be” or, “I will become whatsoever I may become.”

                                                Have you ever thought of where God was before He started the work of creation in Genesis 1 vs 1. If you carefully observe to note that this verse of the Bible began with “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”, It must mean that our
                                                God exists before and his domain is outside the three forces of time (in the beginning), space (heaven) and matter (earth). Like the man who created the computer does not exist within the computer, nor is
                                                he a part of the computer, so does God exist outside time, space and matter. No surprise David said in Psalm 90:2 that, “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the
                                                world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”

                                            <p class="teaching_title_content">
                                                So what was “before” creation? God. He alone exists from everlasting to everlasting. God exists in eternity. He was not created. He is the eternal self-existent One. He is outside of time, space and matter!

                                                When we have these basic understanding of how great and eternal our God is, we are further assured and built on the right foundation and deeper conviction. One can appreciate why the great men of old described these experiences as the “deep things of
                                                God” (1 Corinthians 2:10 ) and “great is the mystery of godliness” ( 1 Timothy 3:16).

                                                As we continue to seek to know more of God, we must also know that we are limited and qualitatively less than God in knowledge and understanding and can never know Him in the same way that He knows Himself. While we can know what He tells us about himself
                                                to the degree that He chooses to let us know. No one can claim the wholesome knowledge of God because He always deal with us at different degrees as commented on in 1 Corinthians 13:9-12, “For we know in
                                                part”. This therefore means that we will spend every day of our lives as Christian to continue to know God more and more until we finally meet Him face to face in heaven.

                                                (1) God is not an object that we use when we are in need. He is also not a genie in a lamp whose job it is to grant our every wish. God is a Being who seeks personal relationship with His creation. He is not a charm or anointing oil. It is an error to
                                                forsake the culture of building relationship with the Lord, but only cry out to Him when there is trouble. This was the similar error the Israelites made during the time of the Judges. They only called on
                                                God when they were in distress, and after helping them, they went back to their old ways, only to bring more trouble into their lives (Judges 2:8-23). God is a person who seeks daily relationship and not
                                                a once-in-a-while interventionist who only comes when there is trouble or there is an exam to be written.

Be careful when your so-called faith confession becomes an act of idolatry
                                                when your desire for things of the world like money, cars, popularity etc. becomes your obsession and a serious passion that you can no longer control. Be alarmed when the time for football, fashion, social
                                                media etc. are getting longer than the time you spend in the presence of the Lord. Our God cannot allow anything to be side-by-side because He is a “jealous” God - Exodus 20:5, and will not compete with
                                                anyone’s vanities.

                                            (3) God is beyond the work of His hand While His work shows what our God is capable of doing, we must never compare God with the work of his hand. For example, we sing popular songs like, “Alagbara Bi Ara”, meaning, “the one that has power like the thunder”,
                                            it is like comparing yourself with a very little thing you have created. You made puff-puff and someone now says to you, “you are as powerful as the puff-puff you made”. It sounds really somehow! The intention
                                            of this is not to criticise those who sing these songs but a clarion call for us to take time to think scripturally before we sing any song that has to do with the greatness of God because these revelations
                                            form the core of our foundation that must never be lowered or ridiculed. You will appreciate even more while comedians must never be allowed to ridicule and make jokes on the things of God.

                                                Our foundation in the knowledge of God determines how far we can go with God. A singer sang, “ I want more of You, I want more of You Jesus, The more I know You, The more I want to know You, Jesus more of You”. This song is the heart cry of everyone who
                                                is seeking to build a sure foundation in a continuous non-stopping knowledge of God.

                                                There is no better time to fortify ourselves in the knowledge of God than now. We must seek to know God more than ever before. God created us to love Him. Our primary purpose is to love God and be loved by Him, to know God intimately and have a loving
                                                relationship with Him. If a man does not have that love, he does not meet his reason for being created

                                                is a loving father, those who have the right foundation of the knowledge of God respectfully serve God in reverence and genuine fear. They serve God in holiness even when they know that He is ever forgiving
                                                and always loving.
