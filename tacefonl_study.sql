(1, 1, 'Paul instructed his son in the faith (Timothy) to remain at Ephesus to regulate the teachings of the newly saved church; a similar assignment continues for us today. The big question to every TACEF member is, “Can you be trusted to preserve the move of revival in your local church? “Many of us easily get distracted when we are entrusted with the responsibility of carrying the burden of the vision. The activities in the church and personal ambition often shift our minds away from the primary reason why God caused us to remain in the church. Many have taken on many assignments that God did not give to them in a quest to please people or to gain prominence, at the detriment of the principal reason of defending the Gospel and mandate of revival. Some will even sacrifice the fellowship meeting time to attend other activities that can give them financial and political benefits.', '2018-02-15 13:00:14'),
(2, 1, 'Beloved, can you be trusted to uphold and defend the cause of revival on your campus or in your local church, even when others have left. It is very sad these days when we see a TACEFite leave the mandate of discipleship to church activities in a quest for personal gain.<br/>Paul’s effort in Ephesus did not waste away even in his absence, unlike many of us whose fellowship collapse as soon as some leaders exit, relocate, or gain admission. We must have a strong sense of service that whatever work is committed into our care must not collapse or be reduced in our hands, just as young Timothy stood firm on the assignment of preserving God’s move in Ephesus.\n', '2018-02-15 13:00:14'),

These “pastors” and “teachers” know that if they tell their disciples what they want to hear and make it sound good, they will “deceive the hearts of the simple” (Rom. 16:17–18). They do not serve our Lord Jesus but their own belly, and use enticing words and fair speeches to deceive their flock into parting with their money. Their preaching is to a “god” who is like a money-doubler. They will tell you to sow one to get millions, not out of a cheerful or a ready heart but more out of covetousness and total greed. All these are gross misapplication of sowing and reaping bountifully (2 Cor. 9:6).', '2018-02-15 13:05:48'),

This falsehood can only bring the judgement of God.', '2018-02-15 13:05:48'),

Never join a minister who asks you to go to a particular junction to pray in the middle of the night or those who give you some strange names to pray with, names that are different from the only name we have been given in heaven and on earth—the Lord Jesus!', '2018-02-15 13:05:48'),

Can you imagine a sister who comes to fellowship with a heart of criticism against another sister who is wearing earring? It will then shock you on the wedding day of this criticising sister when she is fully colour-coated by facial designers and with designer beads dangling on her ear and neck – of course, for the first time!

Many years of walking in His grace and mercy can slowly cause us to forget that we were once filthy, depraved sinners until the Lord Jesus rescued us.

He became a slave trader, falling even further into sin. He narrowly escaped death a number of times. Finally, after nearly perishing in a severe storm at sea, he turned to God and was saved. Even so, he remained in slave trading for a few years. Eventually, by God’s grace, he became a pastor. You probably know him for writing the hymn, “Amazing Grace.” He wrote Deuteronomy 15:15 in bold letters and put it over the mantle of his study, where he could not fail to see it: “Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt and the Lord thy God redeemed thee.”', '2018-02-15 13:17:09'),
(16, 4, 'He also wrote his own epitaph, which read, “John Newton, clerk, once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy.” ', '2018-02-15 13:17:09'),
(17, 4, 'This amazing grace truly transforms the recipient from the inside out. Most of us have heard of people who were once murderers, armed robbers, occultists, prostitutes, and even atheists, who had encounters with the Lord and became completely new persons—on many occasions becoming great preachers of the same Gospel that saved their souls.', '2018-02-15 13:17:09'),
(18, 4, 'We should forever be indebted to God for such an unspeakable blessing through the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. This sense of gratitude must provoke us to reach out to others and to remain committed to the vision of revival because we are not in any way better than those who have not seen the light; grace only made the difference, hence we must be committed to see that others enjoy the same privilege.', '2018-02-15 13:17:09'),

The voice of the Lord was audibly dissected to understand various milestones in the growth and evolution of the fellowship. God’s instruction through prophecy led to specific partnerships, leadership engagement, and many expansions of the vision were downloaded through the power of prophecy, as it pleased the Lord to speak to His people every time.', '2018-02-15 13:21:54'),
(22, 5, 'It is important to note that it is God who determines when, how, and where to speak and it happens when we are in an on-going fellowship with Him or staying long in His presence. It is unbiblical to go and meet someone to prophesy on you—as if prophecy is what can be controlled or place demand on. It is a total error because unlike speaking in tongues, which we can control as we like, prophecy comes by the Spirit of God—and no man can decide to do it at will.', '2018-02-15 13:21:54'),
(23, 5, 'Prophecy comes as you stay in fellowship, prayers and fasting either alone or in the presence of other believers, as a part of a recurring cycle of a lifestyle of consecrated service unto the Lord. Do not be tricked by these lying prophets who ask people to make a prophet’s offering, so as to receive a prophecy. Prophecies are not for sale; they come by the spirit when we are living holy and honourable lives that are full of reasonable service before the Lord.', '2018-02-15 13:21:54'),
(24, 6, 'Since the earliest centuries of the Gospel being spread around the world, there have been several testimonies of how intercessory prayer played a key role and made a difference in regions that were once hostile to the Lord Jesus. Hudson Taylor was a great man of God from Britain who greatly influenced China. The following is a true story of how the intercessions of an unknown believer moved God to bring more souls to Christ through Hudson Taylor’s ministry:', '2018-02-15 13:26:59'),

At one station, the number and spiritual strength of the converts far exceeded anyone’s expectations and could not be accounted for by anything unusual or outstanding about the personnel there. The mystery was unsolved until Hudson Taylor visited England. There, at the close of his message, a gentleman from the audience came forward to greet Taylor. In the ensuing conversation, Taylor learnt that the man possessed detailed knowledge of this particular mission station. “How is it,” asked Taylor, “that you are so conversant with the conditions of that work?” “Oh,” he replied, “for four years I have corresponded with my missionary friend there. He has sent me the names of inquirers and converts, and I have daily taken these to God in prayer.” Taylor suddenly realized the answer to the mystery: the daily, specific prayers of this man in England had brought eternal fruit for God’s glory in China.', '2018-02-15 13:26:59'),
(26, 6, 'Never underestimate God’s willingness to extend His mercy to lost souls after hearing the petitions of His people.

This is nothing but a spiritual misbehaviour that must stop henceforth. The imperative of having the right enthusiasm is important when we are tasked with God’s work. We must be energetic, excited, and well-prepared for every opportunity given to us to do anything on this ground of truth.

Paul advised here that the elders that rule well in the service of the Lord are worthy of “double honour.” The qualifications of “those who rule well” are also explained well in the right context, so that we can place reasonable leadership practice and compensation side by side.

In our study this week, we shall see how Apostle Paul continued in the leadership instructions to the elders—but on a different tone. He addressed the issue of ungodliness in leadership, which usually results in public scandal. A number of specific areas are discussed, such as how an accusation against an elder should be dealt with, the need to publicly rebuke the guilty, judging without partiality, and caution in selecting leaders.

Servants, who had come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, always have a tendency to see their secular, unbelieving masters as unworthy of their loyalty and allegiance since the Lord Jesus Himself was their Lord. But Paul instructed them on the right attitude to adopt instead and how to put things in the right perspective. There were also Christian servants whose masters were believers just like them, and Paul gave instructions about the right attitude and relationship in this sphere as well. There are a number of lessons for us to learn from this study, which apply to present-day Christians, and how we are to view our secular jobs and bosses.

Here, the concern is on how money and material supplies are made to be the most important benefit of salvation rather than being the by-product of salvation. Paul’s worries centred on putting money (or “gain”) first, and godliness as a method of getting gain. Paul used many words and phrases to describe such teachers, finally concluding that such prosperity teachers of errors are “men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth” (1 Tim. 6:5).

In these following verses, we see that the only great gain is godliness, the genuine kind of godliness which brings contentment to the heart of the believer. A big part of his argument is that “we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out” (1 Tim. 6:7). He is here emphasising the transitory nature of our lives through this world and why our understanding of prosperity should be premised on our destination and not on the journey.

While we know that our walk with Christ can be threatened by a number of internal and external factors, the desire for money and wealth may be the greatest threat of all. Paul showed us how the desire leads to a deception, which, in turn, eventually leads to destruction. The ordinate affection for money can be so disastrous and, if left unchecked may become an obsession that leads unto utter dead-end. In this study, the Holy Spirit shows us how this is a hidden trap of the enemy, with unseen consequences that finally bring pain and regret to those who refuse to take heed of the warning.

(27, 20, 'In the last study, Paul had just spoken to Timothy concerning the dangers associated with being covetous and being a lover of money. In this continuing passage of the epistle, his first instruction was for Timothy to “flee these things.” He emphasised the seriousness of the need for a “man of God” to dissociate himself from the worldliness and covetousness of false teachers and those who listen to them. Not only was Timothy supposed to escape from the snare of money, but he was also instructed to actively pursue righteousness and godly virtues. In verse 12, the two exhortations are to “fight the good fight of faith” and to “lay hold on eternal life,” which means he must fight and persevere through all the challenges that come with the Christian faith, while keeping his eyes on eternity the whole time.

True sons are not raised by advice but by God-inspired instructions. The young Timothy must maintain his integrity as a faithful witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, as there were pressures from both within and without the Ephesian church, which could have led to his crumbling. He said that Timothy must keep the commandment “without spot, unrebukable.” Paul used a number of strong points that will lead us into right leadership impetus to raise a generation of grace, excellence, and purpose. This study is just a piece, broken down step-by-step to give us some amazingly glorious reasons why we should be confident to keep God’s commandment without spot and unrebukable. \r\nThe focus is on how the knowledge of God’s glory keeps us strong under pressure.\r\n', '2018-02-15 11:27:23'),
(29, 22, 'After deep insight on the greatness of God, which provides a compelling basis for our ultimate consecration, Paul shifted the focus back to the issue of finances, but he was no longer speaking about those who love money and are covetous, but now addressing the concern of Christians who are already wealthy and have their lives needs met. Having lots of money usually brings pride, and this is the very first thing he warns against. We are not to trust in money, which is “uncertain,” but in God Himself who is the One who gives us everything. Although it is indeed the will of God for His people to prosper financially (3 John 1:2), this prosperity is based on being rich towards God, and rich in doing His will. Paul emphasised the need to be generous and giving, maintaining an attitude of using wealth to do good works. Paul also mentioned the “oppositions of science” in verse 20.

Paul also encouraged his son in the faith to “stir up the gift of God” which was in him, as he was going to need this for successful ministry, and for a victorious fighting of the good fight of faith. The pressures of the Christian walk can sometimes intimidate those who may not be naturally strong at heart, so Paul also reminded him that God has not given us a fearful or timid spirit, but His own Spirit of power, love, and soundness of mind.

Paul was in prison at Rome under the custody of Caesar Nero at this time, from where he wrote the second letter to Timothy. But he never acknowledged himself to be Nero’s prisoner, but a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ.

In this portion of his second letter to Timothy, Paul recounted his present plight, but with special focus on two kinds of persons and how they have treated him in his predicament. He said, first of all, that “All they which are in Asia be turned away from me,” and then specifically mentioned two people named Phygellus and Hermogenes. On the other hand, he spoke well of a man called Onesiphorus, and how he faithfully ministered to Paul in prison as much as he could.

Young brother Timothy had to deal with the general hostility against the Gospel message, false teachers that were causing problems for the congregation, plus his personal health issues. In the midst of all these problems and burdens, the exhortation from Paul was for Timothy to be strong, of course, not to be strong in his own strength, but rather in the grace that is in the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus. Paul knew that it would be impossible for his “son” to carry the weight of the ministry on the foundation of personal effort. Grace, which can only be found in the Lord Jesus Christ, is the sure foundation that upholds and strengthens us through the numerous challenges that come with the Christian life.

First is the soldier, who endures hardship and avoids distractions to please his commander and win the war. Then we have the athlete, who must exercise and compete lawfully before he can receive the crown. Afterwards a farmer, who must not only work on the land but also be very patient before he gets the fruit. These are all analogies of the Christian life.

(39, 30, 'The recurring theme of Paul’s second epistle to Timothy is endurance for the Gospel’s sake. As we have previously mentioned, Paul was in custody of the Roman government awaiting execution, and this was the last of all his epistles. He spoke with deep convictions and passion of a labouring father who was at the end of his race. He continued to speak to encourage Timothy to remain steadfast through any adversity that may come with being a minister of the Gospel. He began his exhortation by reminding Timothy that the Lord whom we serve—the Lord Jesus Christ—became human like us (“the seed of David”), and after suffering and crucifixion, He was raised from the dead. Paul then continued by using his own example to encourage his young son in the faith, showing how he was regarded as a criminal that needed to be bound with chains—with the encouragement being that God’s Word remains unbound regardless of how much his enemies tried to stop his servants from spreading the Good News. He then reminded Timothy on the need to endure for their sake, before he finally closed with an interesting remark that shows us why we must follow the Lord Jesus Christ unto the very end.

(40, 31, 'The focus has shifted again to sound doctrine in this portion of the epistle. Paul began by instructing Timothy that he must see to it that Christians were not striving about words in an unbeneficial way. Timothy himself must “study” and rightly divide the Word to show himself approved unto God, while shunning profane and empty discussions that only further ungodliness. Of course, you cannot stop error if you have not fully learnt about the truth, sufficient to defend it. Paul mentioned two people—Hymenaeus and Philetus, who were spreading false doctrines and damaging people’s faith. But he concluded by asserting that the faith of God’s people stands on a sure foundation. The application of this passage to us has to do with how we properly learn and handle God’s Word. Many people like to argue and debate, not with the intention of edifying others, but to show off their supposed “knowledge.” God’s people must know and rightly divide His Word personally for themselves, through the help of His Spirit.

So, in verse 21, he was only continuing the theme, mentioning the purging from falsehood and iniquity to become a vessel unto honour, which will make us become vessels of good use to the Master.

However, we are told that “foolish and unlearned questions” are to be avoided since they only stir up strife. The confused people who need help cannot be corrected in a spirit of strife and debate, but there are certain characteristics, which we must adopt to instruct them the correct way.

They have a “form” of godliness, but do not truly belong to God. Some of them are also teachers of false doctrines that prey on the weak; and they continually study but never locate the truth (2 Tim. 3:6–7).

While those who are genuinely godly will suffer persecution, the evil false teachers will only sink deeper into deception (2 Tim. 3:12–13). The exhortations in verses 14–15 show that Timothy had learnt from Paul (and possibly other people) and directly from the Scriptures. The overall theme and pivotal message for Timothy and all Christians are in verse 14 where Paul said he must “continue” in those things which he learnt no matter how much persecution he encountered for living godly in the Lord Jesus Christ or how many evil seducers promoted false teachings.

He had just assured Timothy that “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,” and now, therefore, charged him to “preach the word” (2 Tim. 4:2). Since the Scriptures of God are needed for doctrine, reproof, correction, and education in righteousness, preaching the Word faithfully is the primary way to prepare believers before the Lord Jesus returns to “judge the quick and the dead” (2 Tim. 4:1). Though believers are saved from eternal damnation, we shall all still stand before the judgement seat of Christ to give account of our lives (2 Cor. 5:10). Paul signified that a time will come when professing Christians would not abide in sound doctrine (2 Tim.4:3–4) but follow the seducers (2 Tim. 3:13). Timothy, on the other hand, was to watch and remain steadfast, making “full proof” of his ministry (2 Tim. 4:5).

After the critical instructions he had given, Paul was coming close to the end of his writing; he informed Timothy that he was coming close to the end of his life on earth as well. He used a language in verse 6 that made this clear to Timothy, as he was certain he would be executed by the tyrannical emperor of Rome, who saw Paul as an outlaw and criminal (2 Tim. 2:9). But the aged apostle was neither afraid nor sad; he knew he had done his job on earth and fulfilled his ministry and divine assignment (2 Tim. 4:7). He concluded with an emphatic reminder to all Christians that there is a sure “crown of righteousness” awaiting him in heaven; and all who love and anticipate the return of Christ will be partakers of heavenly crowns also (2 Tim. 4:8). The great theme of this portion of the epistle is that the Christian’s life and ministry is a marathon that we must faithfully run to the very end.

Though all Christians are called to\r\nspiritual revival, only few are stepping out to take the call seriously and respond\r\nwholeheartedly. It seems that the backslidden are not ready to return to Jerusalem, even as\r\nmany of the Jews in Babylon weren\'t ready to return, even Babylon has now been taking over\r\nby another country. It is a serious worry that many do not want to return home but prefer to\r\nbecome a second-level slave to another country that has taken over the country that\r\noriginally took them captive.

Each person today who\r\nmakes a decision to follow Christ has entered into a spiritual journey just like the Jews.

This was a major step in\r\nthe process of the assignment of restoration and revival that they came to do in their home\r\nland. Laying appropriate foundation in revival is a very critical step and the fact that as soon as\r\nthis was done, the priests and Levites were set in order to worship God in accordance with\r\nhow David had appointed them for the first temple (Ezra 3:10, 1Chron.

Of course,\r\nthey were not happy that the Jews had returned and may now be establishing permanent\r\nresidences.

Indeed, many\r\nchurches today have mixed the enemy\'s agenda with that of God, in a condemnable modern\r\nday Christianity when the church is not different from a club house, a political rally or a\r\nmagician circus.

The main narrative of chapter 4 is the building of the house of\r\nGod (the temple), but verses 6-23 are not talking about the temple; instead, they show how\r\nthe Samaritans not only resisted the Jews from building the temple during Cyrus\' reign, but\r\nalso how they resisted them from building Jerusalem as a city along with its walls during the\r\nreigns of Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes. One of the things wewill see in this study is that verses 7-\r\n23 are actually talking about the Jews who came back with Ezra during Artaxerxes\' reign as\r\nshown in Ezra chapter 7. This is why these parenthetical verses (6-23) only mention the city\r\nof Jerusalem with its walls, but no accusations against the temple, which had already been\r\ncompleted under Darius before this time.\r\nThe crucial element of this study today is how the Samaritans laid accusations against the\r\nJews and Jerusalem as a city, which caused the king to stop the building of the city.

Our study text this week\r\nshows how an account of Cyrus\' edict is found, and how Darius subsequently sends a reply\r\nmessage to Tatnai, ordering that not only should he allow the Jews to build the temple, but\r\nany additional expenses they need for the temple and for the daily offerings should be given\r\nto them out of the royal treasury in Tatnai\'s jurisdiction. Darius also adds a strong warning of\r\ndestruction to anyone (including kings) who alters his commands or destroys the Jerusalem\r\ntemple (6:11-12). Tatnai has no choice but to speedily do as the king says, and the Jews\r\nFINALLY finish the temple with encouragement from Haggai and Zechariah. This sounds so\r\nunbelievable but a true reflection of how God works when we commit ourselves to the\r\nmandate of rebuilding and revival. God has a way of coming through in a measure that is\r\nbeyond our expectation.

All the previous works that we have seen\r\nhave been carried out by Zerrubabel, Jeshua, Haggai and Zechariah. We are now formally\r\nintroduced to the man Ezra, who was a priest and a scribe in Babylon making a return to\r\nJerusalem after the temple has been built. He appears to be coming for the second phase of\r\nthe work after the temple has been completed.<br/>\r\nUnlike certain priests who could not trace their lineage in our previous study (2:59-63), Ezra\r\ncould prove through his genealogy that he was indeed a descendant of Aaron (7:1-5). He was\r\nthe man who built on the work of the temple to bring about true revival in the real sense of\r\nthe word and we shall understand this as we progress in this study. This study shows Ezra as a\r\nman of God indeed, who not only loved and practiced God\'s Word, but also had a great\r\nburden on his heart to go to Israel and teach God\'s people the way of the LORD (7:10). He\r\nmade a request of the king to allow him to return to the land of his ancestors, which the king\r\ngranted and also supported heavily through God\'s divine favour (7:6, 11-26).

But there arose a problem in verse 15,\r\nnamely, that Ezra could not find any Levites among all those people. There were priests, but\r\nno Levites (that is, non-priests from the tribe of Levi); and Levites were needed to minister in\r\ndifferent roles in the temple as helpers to the priests in the temple\'s overall daily operations.\r\nIs it not often the problem these days?

Ezra\'s response was first and foremost a heartfelt grief, as he tore his\r\ngarments in unbelief of what he was hearing, plucking out his hair before sitting down in deep\r\nastonishment of how a nation had receded in its service to God. But like a true agent of\r\nrevival, he could only remain inactive for a short time. By the evening sacrifice, he got on his\r\nknees and made a deep, heartfelt, remorseful confession of Israel\'s transgression to God.\r\nThough he was not guilty of this particular sin, he still identified himself as unworthy before\r\nGod, frequently using the terms “our” and “we” in his expression of the nation\'s error.

There are many\r\nvaluable leadership lessons here. One of the clear reasons he did so was because he needed\r\ntime to do a feasibility study of the city, taking note of the damages and what amount of\r\nresources would precisely be needed for the work of rebuilding. He needed to translate the\r\nspiritual burden into clear easy-to-understand physical details.

He did not want anyone to interfere\r\nwith this crucial process. Verse 16 again shows that he did all the evaluation in the night to\r\navoid any distraction or call any unnecessary attention to himself. He effectively toured and\r\nexamined the city during the <b>night</b> as was mentioned in verses 12-13.

Matthew 3:8 says that the genuinely\r\nrepentant sinner must,“Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance”. Verses 4-6\r\nmention the names of some Levites who admonished the people to rise and bless the Name\r\nof the LORD, before they led them into a long session of prayer of confession of Israel\'s sins\r\nboth past and present. This prayer takes up the rest of chapter 9 (from verses 7-37),\r\nrecounting from Abram\'s early beginnings before going into how Israel\'s history is filled with\r\ntheir disobedience to the Lord and His judgements and mercies towards them. The prayer\r\nconcludes with a petition for God\'s mercy concerning their present situation, including how\r\nthey were presently being ruled by the kingdom of Persia which was part of God\'s judgement\r\nfor all their sins (v. 32-37).<br/>\r\nAfter the solemn prayer, chapter 10 records how the people entered into a covenant with\r\nGod by oath, vowing to live by all His laws, which were handed to Moses.

(144,100,'The answer to the dilemma highlighted above is in Walking in the Spirit, and this is what we will be looking at in this study under the following teachings:','2019-10-22 14:36:30');

(145,102,'“Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away” (Mathew 21:18 -19).          I believe we are familiar with this story. Something very striking about it is the desire of God. He desires fruit from our lives, and can decide to check us out any time, any day to request for fruit. The fig tree in question did not know Jesus would “randomly check it out”. Jesus was expecting figs or fruits from the fig tree, but found only leaves. There is something interesting and historical about fig leaves. You will recall that fig leaves were used by Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness after the fall in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:7). They used the leaves to cover their true state and reality. So, in a way, we can see that the fig leaves tend to act as a covering we use to provide false impression of what we are not. We do a lot of activities year-in year-out, coloured and coated with the name of God, but lacking in the reality of God. We appear religious, but the righteousness of God is not evident in our lives.  What the Lord desires is fruit, and not leaves, not mere activities that are having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof (2 Timothy 3:5). That was why Jesus declared in Matthew 7:20, saying, “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them”.','2019-10-22 14:37:30');

(146,102,'It is our fruits that show if truly we are have a sure foundation in Christ or not.  Since we have the seed of God in us by the help of the Holy Spirit, God expects us to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit as outlined in Galatians 5:22 – 23 (NLT), “ But the Holy Spirit produces these kind of fruits in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things! Like begets like. We cannot claim we belong to God and be producing fruits of the wicked. The Bible says, “For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes” (Luke 6:44). If truly we have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Saviour, then, we have the Spirit of God in us for as many that received Him (that received Jesus), He gave them power to become the sons of God (John 1:12). If truly we have the Spirit of God, then we “MUST” exhibit the fruits of the Spirit. It is not a choice; it is a “MUST”.\n
This week, we shall consider  the following topics:','2019-10-22 14:38:30');

(147,103,'In an earlier study, we have come to an understanding on the personality of the Holy Spirit and with this understanding comes the question “what are the benefits of having, knowing or allowing the Holy Spirit in my life as a child of God?” This study is set to explore the great benefit that God’s children have in the Holy Spirit – The Gifts of the Spirit.','2019-10-22 14:38:30');

(148,103,'The Gifts of the Spirit are unique skills and abilities given by the Holy Spirit to faithful followers of Christ to serve God for the common benefit of His people, the church and sustain us for eternity. They are simply, God empowering faithful Christians to do what He has called us to do. 2 Peter 1:3 says, "His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness." The gifts of the Holy Spirit are part of "everything we need" to accomplish His plans for our lives.','2019-10-22 14:39:30');

(149,103,'The Holy Spirit can manifest anyone of the gifts through any believer anytime He wants  to do so. Each of these gifts are supernatural, miraculous manifestations which comes directly from the Holy Spirit Himself and any Christian can get themselves in proper place to receive these gifts, as the apostle Paul himself tells us to stir up the gift of God, 2Tim 1:6. These gifts are a tremendous help and aid not only to a child of God in his/her own personal walk with the Lord, but many of them can also be used to help other people out, as special needs and circumstances arise in their lives – 1 Cor 12:7 says that these gifts are given “as a means of helping the church NLT.”\n
To have a deeper understanding of this benefit we have in the Holy Spirit, we shall consider:
','2019-10-22 14:40:30');

(150,105,'The church was founded on revelation of the personality of Christ (Matthew 16:16), however, the sustainability and continuity of the church depends largely on “the great commission” of our Lord and master Jesus Christ to us believers to “go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” and then “….thou shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8).','2019-10-22 14:41:30');

(151,105,'The rate at which churches spring up everywhere with large crowd in attendance is such that one could have easily concluded that the church (body of Christ) is experiencing tremendous growth, however, it is only church attendance that is increasing numerically (gathering of multitude) while the body of Christ is experiencing a great decline','2019-10-22 14:42:30');

(152,105,'The reason for this great decline is because the great commission has been neglected by individuals; the “tell others about Jesus” mindset of individual believers is no longer there, the lifestyle of personal evangelism is fast disappearing, giving way to other substitutes that are not adding up to the body of Christ in terms of quality of believers.        
In this study, we shall be considering the following teachings:','2019-10-22 14:43:30');

(153,106,'The desire of God for His children is to live each day of their lives in the supernatural, which is something that is above and beyond ordinary natural life. When He made man in His own image in Genesis 1:26-27, He did that with the intention for us to dominate and subdue the earth. It takes the supernatural to have dominion over the earth. Man lost this dimension of glory when sin came, but it was restored when Jesus died and resurrected. Our Lord Jesus Christ went about doing good works, healing the oppressed, raising the dead, opening the blind eyes, and practically living the life of the supernatural while on earth. We cannot do less. Little wonder the Bible says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father” (John 14:12). Our Lord expects us to do greater works than He did when He was here on earth. These supernatural works are not limited to spiritual dimensions; they also include physical works. This is our default mode as born again Christians. The Bible says, “Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken” (John 10:34 -35). This scripture reveals God’s expectation for our lives – to live a daily walk of miracles in our academics, career, business, family, marriage, health, finance, ministry and every other area of our lives.','2019-10-22 14:44:30');

(154,106,'The bible, from Genesis to Revelation consists of chronicles of the display of God's miraculous acts to demonstrate His absolute sovereignty and showcase His mightiness. They are written to strengthen our resolve and absolute confidence in the supernatural power of God to do wonders. From creation to specific miracles of healing, provision, wondrous move of God to His promise of mighty miracle among us that believe, God is confirming one truth, He is a miracle working God that wants every of His children and all those who believe in Him to experience the wonders He can do on a daily basis.','2019-10-22 14:45:30');

(155,106,'As believers, the supernatural should be our natural! We ought to be doing “exploits” for God. And we can! Therefore, we shall consider the following subtopics in this study:','2019-10-22 14:46:30');

(156,107,'To pant after God means to long with breathless or intense eagerness; deep yearning for God. Intense desires for God's presence as the baby desire the sincere milk. As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.','2019-10-22 14:47:30');

(157,107,'King David’s thirsting after God was characteristic of the heartfelt desire of all God’s people in proportion to the realization of their need of divine grace. The very life of a hart depends upon the refreshing waters of the brook. Likewise, our lives as Christians depend upon the springs of divine grace and mercy which flow from God to us when we put ourselves in a position to receive the blessings with which He stands ready to supply us so abundantly. The hart panteth after the water brooks because water quenches thirst and sustains life; so, those who have learned to know God “pant” after Him because they know they cannot live without the life-sustaining provisions of His love and grace.','2019-10-22 14:49:30');

(158,107,'To “thirst” after God means much more than merely to desire Him. One might desire something which is not a vital necessity to life. A Christian does indeed desire God; yea, he longs to know Him better, and to depend upon Him fully but the thought of thirsting after God as the hart thirsteth for water brooks, goes beyond desire. It denotes the recognition of necessity. If thirst is not assuaged, death is the result. Thus, for a Christian to thirst after God means that he is willing to set aside all other considerations so that his thirst might be quenched.','2019-10-22 14:50:30');

(159,107,'The mandate of TACEF came up after several days of longing for revival in the African Church by the pioneers though studying in school, their undying love for God and passion for souls brought about the mandate of raising an army with a vision of revival where so many were birthed in today.\n
In the course of this study, we shall examine critically:','2019-10-22 14:50:30');

(160,108,'Our society has defined a leader as a person who gives commands and therefore the one who is to be served by others. While this may be true in some worldly scenarios, the Biblical model for the ideal leader is a person who is here to serve. A Christian leader is to be more concerned about how he can be of useful service to others than how he can be served by others. Christian leadership requires a heart that is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good of the ones being led. We must remind ourselves that leadership is not only for pastors or fellowship executives. We are all called to be leaders to one degree or the other, because we all have the capacity to influence others with God’s Word. This is a powerful way of building a firm foundation in Christ when we have a heart that seeks to serve and be beneficial to others. The underlying topics for this study are:','2019-10-22 14:51:30');

(161,109,'Every person is accountable before GOD, FOR WE SHALL ALL GIVE Account before God, even account of resources handed over to us, there will be no excuses. There is a common saying which is actually an error, “I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul”. This is a mistake because we are all accountable to God, Ezek.18:4; “all souls are Mine”.','2019-10-22 14:52:30');

(162,109,'Accountability is simply being responsible for one’s actions, Rom.14:12, we will all be responsible for all our actions including how we spend our time and finances (time and finance are given to us by God and we have to give account of them Lk.12:48).','2019-10-22 14:53:30');

(163,109,'There have been misunderstanding of financial resources and misappropriation of financial resources, the world is being destroyed because finances are not being used according to the plan and purpose of God. God desires us to manage our finances His way not ours, so, it is important to learn financial management God’s way.','2019-10-22 14:54:30');

(164,109,'God has been around forever before time existed, He inhabits eternity, He created time Isaiah57:15. He is unrestricted by time IIPeter3:8. Though, God is not controlled by time the way humans are, He still put great emphasis on time (He is always punctual, He acts at the right time). God created time as a tool, as a Christian, time management means learning to use time as God wants us to use it, Eph.5:15-16. Time management is a divine mandate for us; God will judge our use of time Eccl.3:17.','2019-10-22 14:55:30');

(1, 1, 'The primary reason Paul left Timothy at Ephesus was because of certain teachers in the church who had begun to mix the truth of Christ with “other” doctrines (1 Tim. 1:3). Paul knew that accurately teaching the truth was foundational in creating strong disciples, while falsehoods would only bring a church to spiritual ruin. Today, many churches still have the same problem the Ephesians had, as the Word of God is being mixed with other doctrines that are not of God.', '2018-02-17 17:57:38'),
(2, 1, 'Just as Timothy was called (among other things) to defend the truth, we today are under a similar obligation to rise for the truth of the Word of God. False doctrines not only pervert the believers, but also bring division in the Body of Christ, as Paul strongly cautioned us (1 Cor. 1:10). Such division, in turn, weakens the overall witness of the Church to an unbelieving and skeptical world, and many who are curious do not even know which “church” to join. Let us, therefore, strive to be of reasonable service to God, in accordance with what He Himself has revealed in His Word.', '2018-02-17 17:57:38'),
(3, 2, 'Paul referred to Timothy as his own son in the faith. Their relationship translated into salvation coming to many peoples in different parts of the world. In the Acts of the Apostles and in the Epistles, we have a record of how these two champions of Christ worked side by side, along with other ministers of the Gospel, to propel the Great Commission to the ends of the Roman Empire. Paul could trust Timothy with a simple task like bringing him his cloak and books (2 Tim. 4:13), or with far more critical responsibilities as abiding at Ephesus to help protect the believers from deception. They had that kind of a relationship. Paul could trust Timothy with a very personal task and a general assignment. It is sad today that there is a scarcity of reputable and dependable sons, who can be trusted to where and when it matters most. Men and women of great grace apply their intelligent reasoning and full senses with total faithfulness to discharge kingdom tasks with excellence and even far beyond what is expected of them. We can always be sure not to find gaps with these kinds of people because they fully commit their mind to the firm principle that God deserves only the best—irrespective of their challenges, excuses, or limitations.', '2018-02-17 17:57:38'),
(4, 3, 'The first key lesson from this study is how tampering with God’s truth brings problems for both the church and the ones doing the false teaching. The false teachers bring upon themselves “swift destruction” (2 Pet. 2:1). For the church, misleading doctrines bring division and confusion, and usually leads to the hearers becoming false teachers themselves; “seducers” will grow worse and worse, “deceiving and being deceived” (2 Tim. 3:13).', '2018-02-17 18:03:31'),
(5, 3, 'The Lord Jesus has clearly stated that not everyone who calls Him Lord will enter into His kingdom, but only those who do the will of the Father (Matt. 7:21). Part of His will is that we “teach no other doctrine,” as Paul instructed Timothy at Ephesus to ensure this. False teaching, therefore, can ultimately keep people from entering God’s eternal kingdom (Rev. 22:19). These should be sobering realities that should keep us diligent in ensuring that not only are we receiving correct teaching from God’s Word, but that we ourselves never veer off the straight and narrow path of Truth when teaching others.  Therefore, beware of the so-called “new revelation” or “another Gospel.”', '2018-02-17 18:03:31'),

Just as it was in Paul and Timothy’s time, we also are living in an age of deception with a multitude of false beliefs being mixed within the church. We must be careful to keep our eyes on the prize (the Lord Jesus and heaven). Fables, endless genealogies, and speculations are really a strategy of the enemy to bring distraction and throw us off important things. The Lord’s sheep hear His voice only, and will not adhere to the voice of false doctrines (John 10:4–5).

(8, 5, 'A false teacher refuses to agree with the plain revelation of God’s Word. He desires to be a teacher of his own version of truth and draw disciples unto himself. Pride is a common trait among such people, so the matter is to be handled delicately, “in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves . . .” (2 Tim. 2:25). Perhaps, God will give them the grace to repent and acknowledge the truth.', '2018-02-17 18:03:31'),

We must also point out that God Himself has said that adding and subtracting from His Word have eternal consequences.

We must never give up on anyone as far as issues of salvation is concerned. The worst sinner is not out of God’s reach—there is always hope. The power of God is able to change the human heart and mind from delusion and depravity to faith and obedience. God has always been a God of mercy and grace, and we saw this first displayed in the Garden of Eden. After Adam and Eve fell into transgression, they tried to “cover their nakedness” literally by sewing fig leaves for themselves. But God in His mercy killed an animal (probably a lamb) to give them proper covering physically and also spiritually, as He later revealed (Lev. 17:11) that the blood makes atonement for the soul. This was a foreshadowing of the coming Lamb of God (the Lord Jesus), who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

Though Paul regarded himself as the least of all apostles, he surely laboured more than they did (1 Cor. 15:9–10). Even Peter had to acknowledge the abundance of revelation and wisdom given unto Paul (2 Pet. 3:15–16). He was forgiven for much, and this great forgiveness translated into great love and service for the Lord and Saviour.

(20, 12, 'Our first major lesson from this study is how prayer should be a priority in the Christian’s walk with God. As simple as it may seem, prayer is actually a supernatural engagement. Prayer is not an “on and off” act, but a lifestyle. We can only speak freely with God if we get to know Him and build friendship with Him. This is why Moses could stand in the gap and pray for days because it was not about time spent but relationship that was being nurtured (Exod. 32:9–14). The Bible says that God spoke to Moses “face to face” as a man speaks with his friend (Exod. 33:11). No wonder Moses commanded so much authority and became one of God’s greatest servants. This kind of relationship is foundational for our prayers to be heard and answered. You cannot succeed in life without a prayer life that comes through a relationship with God and not just vigil, prayer meeting etc. ', '2018-02-17 18:29:56'),
(21, 13, 'God in the New Testament encourages us to always pray. Men ought always to pray and not be tired (Luke 18:1). We are to pray without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:17). But then God tells us to not only pray always, but also pray with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit (Eph. 6:18). So even though Paul specifically mentioned only four kinds of prayer in verse 1 of our study text, the higher reality is that the ways and dimensions which we can pray to God are not restricted. The point is that we can talk to God in any dimension we wish because He is actually a person with a personality, not a robot. That is why Paul said he could pray with the spirit and pray with the understanding also (1 Cor. 14:14-15); he could even sing his prayers to God if he liked. Even when we are weak and do not know exactly how to express ourselves to God, His own Spirit makes intercession for us with “groaning” which cannot be uttered (Rom. 8:26). It is good to understand the four dimensions of “supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving,” but we should also know that our God is a genuine person and there are manifold ways in which we can commune with Him, either for ourselves or on behalf of others.', '2018-02-17 18:29:56'),

We saw an example of this above when He was about to destroy Israel but changed His mind after the deep intercession of Moses (His friend). We are called by God a “royal priesthood” (1 Pet. 2:9) made up of kings and priests (Rev. 1:6). One of the functions of a priest is to intercede and stand in the gap between God and man. In Ezekiel 22:30-31, God was looking for someone to intercede on behalf of the people of the land, but found no one. The people ultimately received the righteous judgement of God upon them and were destroyed. If people had stood in the gap as Moses did, they would have been spared. We are called to stand in the gap for our nation and particularly for our church as a fellowship that is called unto revival.

The Lord Jesus Himself said to God the Father, “not my will, but thine, be done” (Luke 22:42). He was willing to submit Himself to the higher will of God the Father, and so must we. Though following Him may get tough sometimes, we should never get discouraged. He has never promised us a smooth journey but a glorious destination. We must always be reminded that we have a guaranteed promise: “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord” (1 Cor. 15:58).<br/>\r\nThe conclusion is that we must endure the hardships and challenges that come with being identified as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, if we hope to receive the reward of reigning with Him forever in glory.

Our degree of identification with His suffering is also an indicator of the degree of our glorification in His rising, hence a need to endure hardship as joint-heirs with Him (Rom. 8:17).

The error of many is that they desire to have special knowledge of the Bible and, therefore, begin to invent spiritual doctrines that are non-existent in the passage.

Some will build valuable works with their salvation, represented as gold, silver, and precious stones; but others will build weak structures and poor service, represented as wood, hay, and stubble (1 Cor. 3:10-15). Though there could possibly be more, the Bible mentions at least five crowns, that deserving Christians will receive from the Lord when that day comes. The crown of rejoicing is reserved for soul winners. The crown of righteousness is for Christians who are diligent in righteousness. The crown of glory is reserved for church leaders who have ruled well. The imperishable crown is for those who have exercised self-denial to please God. And the crown of life is for martyrs.', '2018-02-20 16:12:14'),
(158, 68, 'You may ask how an individual can wear three or four crowns on the same head. Well, we do know that even in the ancient Rome, kings used to wear three crowns of iron, silver, and gold. The Bible also records that the Lord Jesus had many crowns upon His head as King of kings (Rev. 19:12). Therefore, our aim should be to strive to obtain as many crowns as the Lord gives us the gifts and opportunity to serve His purpose. Paul qualified for all the five crowns listed. As we pour out our lives in reasonable service to the Lord, we should keep in mind that He takes account of our devotion and ministry, and He will one day return to give every man according as His work shall be (Matt. 16:27, Rev. 22:12).', '2018-02-20 16:12:14'),
(159, 69, 'Even in Paul’s affliction, when it seemed as if the whole world had deserted him, the Lord Jesus was right by his side at all times, keeping him company, putting joy in his heart, cheering him up, and encouraging him to keep moving forward. The Lord Jesus has promised to never leave nor forsake us, and to be with us to the very end (Matt. 28:20). Before Paul’s house arrest at Rome, the Lord Himself had personally appeared at least once to him after his salvation experience (Acts 18:9–10) and, on another occasion, sent an angel to him (Acts 27:23–25). On both occasions, he had an assurance of protection from the Lord, along with his guaranteed presence. We must always remember whom we serve and whom has called us into the Christian life and ministry. The certainty of our safety cannot be doubted. We are not going out on our own charges and the One who sent us is fully there by our side.', '2018-02-20 16:33:34'),
(160, 69, 'There came a time in Elijah’s life when he was in a situation that looked like all Israel had forsaken him as a lone ranger fighting against the Baal kingdom (1 Kings 19:9–18), but in reality, God was with him and had also reserved seven thousand people in Israel who had not fallen away into apostasy (1 Kings 19:18). God was also with Paul in his loneliest season, but like Elijah and Israel, the Lord also reserved a small amount of people for Paul, such as Timothy, Luke, and Onesiphorus as back-up supporters or intercessors to give human touch of God\'s always-there presence.', '2018-02-20 16:33:34'),
(161, 69, 'He will never let us down; he will never fail us; he will never forsake us. He knows that the road is a little rough and that there are many challenges. As we continue to fulfil our course on earth, let us keep the reality of his everlasting presence in our minds, which will enable us to overcome all trials.', '2018-02-20 16:33:34'),
(162, 70, 'Though Paul was old, imprisoned, and forsaken by many trusted friends, he did not allow such things to stop his ministry of the Gospel. He used Mark to take care of some ministerial duties, which his limitations would not permit him to do himself. He was still a useful vessel to the Lord and he knew that by him “the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear” (2 Tim. 4:17). He even kept studying and learning from books to continue developing spiritually and mentally for more effectiveness in his ministry. He still believed he had a ministry and could still do more as long as he was alive and breathing. This is the right attitude to have for Christians of all ages under all circumstances.', '2018-02-20 16:33:34'),
(163, 70, 'In our world today, we are faced with all kinds of negativities and oppositions to the truth and righteousness. Our co-workers might despise us or our employers deny us of rightful promotions. We may also find ourselves not being adequate financially as we would like to be, desiring to take God’s Word and kingdom further than where we presently are. In spite of all these and other personal challenges, we must determine in our hearts and minds to continue serving the Lord faithfully and with enthusiasm just like Paul. The fact that admission has not come, marriage is delayed, or a good job has not materialised must never be an excuse to reduce our commitment to the kingdom. The fact that we are still believing God for the fruit of the womb does not mean we cannot be fruitful in other areas and carry lives in the womb of grace. No Christian has any excuse to take eyes off the joy of eternity because of the short-time pain of the temporal life that we live. No one can compare a hundred years on earth with billions of years in eternity, which is like a drop of a grain of sand in an ocean!', '2018-02-20 16:33:34'),
(164, 70, 'Throughout history, God’s people have had to deal with varying forms of trials, which could have made them give up or feel they have already done enough. But the true heroes are those who have kept on doing God’s will till their final breath. May we continue in reasonable service to God for the full length of our lives. May we be diligent and happy to serve for as long as we are alive in this physical body, in the Lord Jesus’ name. Amen.', '2018-02-20 16:33:34');

Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and\r\ncome down to you?”[4] Yet they sent unto me four times in this manner, and I answered them\r\nin the same manner.[5] Then Sanballat sent his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time\r\nwith an open letter in his hand,[6] wherein was written: “It is reported among the heathen,\r\nand Geshem saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the\r\nwall, that thou mayest be their king according to these words.[7] And thou hast also\r\nappointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, \'There is a king in Judah!\' And now\r\nshall it be reported to the king according to these words.

So didst Thou get Thee a name, as it is this day.[11] And Thou didst divide the sea before\r\nthem, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors\r\nThou threwest into the deep, as a stone into the mighty waters.[12] Moreover Thou leddest\r\nthem in the day by a cloudy pillar, and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the\r\nway wherein they should go.[13] Thou camest down also upon Mount Sinai and spokest with\r\nthem from heaven, and gavest them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and\r\ncommandments;[14] and madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst\r\nthem precepts, statutes, and laws by the hand of Moses Thy servant;[15] and gavest them\r\nbread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for\r\ntheir thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which Thou hadst\r\nsworn to give them.[16] “But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks\r\nand hearkened not to Thy commandments.[17] And they refused to obey, neither were\r\nmindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their\r\nrebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But Thou art a God ready to pardon,\r\ngracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.[18]\r\nYea, when they had made them a molten calf and said, \'This is thy God who brought thee up\r\nout of Egypt,\' and had wrought great provocations,[19] yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies\r\nforsookest them not in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day,\r\nto lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light and the way\r\nwherein they should go.[20] Thou gavest also Thy good Spirit to instruct them, and\r\nwithheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.[21]\r\nYea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their\r\nclothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not.[22] Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms\r\nand nations, and didst divide them into corners; so they possessed the land of Sihon and the\r\nland of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og, king of Bashan.[23] Their children also did\r\nThou multiply as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land which Thou hadst\r\npromised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.[24] So the children went in and\r\npossessed the land, and Thou did subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the\r\nCanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land,\r\nthat they might do with them as they would.[25] And they took strong cities and a fat land,\r\nand possessed houses full of all goods, wells dug out, vineyards and olive yards, and fruit\r\ntrees in abundance. So they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves\r\nin Thy great goodness.[26] “Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against Thee,\r\nand cast Thy law behind their backs, and slew Thy prophets who testified against them to\r\nturn them to Thee; and they wrought great provocations.[27] Therefore Thou deliveredst\r\nthem into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them. And in the time of their trouble when\r\nthey cried unto Thee, Thou heardest them from heaven; and according to Thy manifold\r\nmercies Thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.[28]\r\n“But after they had rest, they did evil again before Thee. Therefore leftest Thou them in the\r\nhand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned and\r\ncried unto Thee, Thou heardest them from heaven. And many times didst Thou deliver them\r\naccording to Thy mercies,[29] and testifiedst against them, that Thou mightest bring them\r\nagain unto Thy law. Yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto Thy commandments, but\r\nsinned against Thy judgments (which if a man do, he shall live in them), and withdrew the\r\nshoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear.[30] “Yet many years didst Thou\r\nforbear them, and testifiedst against them by Thy Spirit in Thy prophets. Yet would they not\r\ngive ear; therefore gavest Thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.[31]\r\nNevertheless for Thy great mercies\' sake Thou did not utterly consume them nor forsake\r\nthem, for Thou art a gracious and merciful God. [32] “Now therefore, our God, the great, the\r\nmighty, and the fearsome God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem\r\nlittle before Thee that hath come upon us—on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests,\r\nand on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all Thy people since the time of the kings of\r\nAssyria unto this day.[33] Nevertheless, Thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for Thou\r\nhast done right, but we have done wickedly.[34] Neither have our kings, our princes, our\r\npriests, nor our fathers kept Thy law, nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and Thy\r\ntestimonies, wherewith Thou didst testify against them.[35] For they have not served Thee in\r\ntheir kingdom, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fat\r\nland which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.[36]\r\nBehold, we are servants this day; and for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat\r\nthe fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.[37] And it yieldeth much\r\nincrease unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have\r\ndominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure, and we are in great\r\ndistress.[38] “And because of all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes,\r\nLevites, and priests set their seal unto it.”<br/>\r\n<h4>10</h4> Now those who sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hachaliah, and\r\nZedekiah,[2] Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,[3] Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,[4] Hattush,\r\nShebaniah, Malluch,[5] Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,[6] Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,[7]\r\nMeshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,[8] Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah;

Those of us who have been paying attention can see some of those signs which the\r\nprophets spoke of already coming to pass. For example, Daniel 12 is explicitly about the end\r\ntimes, and two of the signs wesee today are found in verse 4—“But you, O Daniel, shut up the\r\nwords and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall travel to and fro, and\r\nknowledge shall be increased.” There are two prophecies in that one verse which are being\r\nfulfilled as we speak: (1) The earth has never known a time in history where humans travel\r\nlike they do today, whether by aeroplane, train, cars, etc. It is unprecedented, and the world\r\nwill most likely become more and more of a “global village” in the years ahead. (2)\r\nKnowledge shall be increased. This is happening tremendously in two ways. First, the\r\nInternet age has opened up a vast library and wealth of knowledge which individual people\r\nhad previously never had access to, all, literally, at our fingertips. Even little children go on\r\nthe internet nowadays and dig up knowledge that they would never have had access to\r\notherwise. Second, the Hebrew word da?ath means knowledge in English and the English\r\nword comes directly from the Latin scientia which means “science” or “knowledge”. The\r\nprophecy literally says “...science shall be increased.” Today, Biblical prophecies are already\r\nbeing whispered in the news as science headlines. For example, some celestial bodies from\r\nouter space are predicted in Matthew and Revelation to strike the earth during the last days,\r\nand NASA (National Aeronautical Space Agency of America) has reported objects close to\r\nearth with attendant threat. Some different parts of the world sit on major fault-lines that\r\nhave caused massive earthquakes in the past, but earthquake geologists predict that we\r\nhave not experienced the highest possible magnitude earthquakes yet. Many other\r\nexamples can be given, but the matter at hand is that God\'s people need to keep their eyes\r\nopen as the Lord commanded us to do in Matthew 24:32-33. The more we study the Bible\r\nand the end-time prophecy, the more we are informed when these events come to pass, and\r\nthis can only spark our faith and encourage us to draw nearer to God. This will also fire our\r\nenergy to propagate the gospel of revival. When you imagine how many adults and children\r\nin our local churches and communities who will go into Christ-less eternity, there will be a\r\nsincere push for deeper intercession, consistent discipleship through local fellowships and\r\nstrategic outreaches to lead many to Jesus.', '2018-11-02 12:35:14'),

This kind of prayer is the catalyst for\r\nsupernatural chain reactions in the realm of the Spirit. “The effectual fervent prayer of a\r\nrighteous man availeth much” (James 5:16). If the effectual fervent prayer of one righteous\r\nman avails much, then surely where two or three are gathered together in Jesus Name, He is\r\nright there in the midst, and if even two such people can agree on earth as touching\r\nanything they shall ask, it shall be done for them by our heavenly Father (Matt. 18:19-20).', '2018-11-02 12:54:30'),

(132, 90,'Salvation is God’s greatest gift to humanity and it must be treated as such. One can better appreciate why Paul admonished us all to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. “Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure”. (Philippians 2:12-13)','2019-10-31 12:48:19');
(133, 90,'But why do we need to work out our salvation when works do not save us? We know that truly that we are saved by God’s unconditional grace through the gift of faith, the works we do prove that our faith is real. Works are evidence of genuine salvation but works never qualified us for salvation.','2019-10-31 12:49:19');
(134, 90,'For emphasis, the phrase, “Work out…” as applied in working something out is to prove it to be true. When we work out a mathematics problem, we are not fundamentally changing the answer. Two plus two always equals four. What we do daily is to balance this equation or work it out – that is - add up what is right, subtract what should be eliminated, multiply those things that must be evident so that we arrive at the desired answer. In other words, God has already done the work of salvation in us – He has saved us, forgiven us, rescued us, put his Holy Spirit in us, and united us to Jesus. That glorious work has already been done. But, that does not mean that we simply sit back and do nothing. Never. We are called to do good works as a way of showing that God does indeed live in us. These good works in NO way earn our salvation. They are simply proof of what God has already done in us. This is captured well in James 2:14, “What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?”','2019-10-31 12:50:19');
(134, 90,'We must also note the verse, where we realise that the “working” out is also done by God in us.  Paul says, “…for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.” ','2019-10-31 12:51:19');
(135, 90,'This understanding that we are saved by His grace will cause us to be more faithful in our service to Him. This awareness will prevent us from falling into spiritual pride and will be the reason we will not go back to our vomit. It will be the compelling reason why our roots will go deep in God, helping us establish a firm foundation in Him which cannot be shaken by any challenges of life.','2019-10-31 12:52:19');
(136, 91,'Genuine repentance leads to a desire to redress wrongs. When someone becomes a Christian, he will have a desire born of deep conviction to do good, and that includes making  restitution whenever possible. The idea of “whenever possible” is crucially important to remember. There are some crimes and sins for which there is no adequate restitution. In such instances, a Christian should make some form of restitution that demonstrates repentance, but at the same time, does not need to feel guilty about the inability to make full restitution. Restitution is to be a result of our salvation—it is not a requirement for salvation. If you have received forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ, all of your sins are forgiven, whether or not you have been able to make restitution for them','2019-10-31 12:53:19');
(137, 91,'The summary of this teaching is that those who have turned from sin must also seek ways to correct wrongs and damages done to others in the past. This is one of the practical fruits of true repentance and godly sorrow. Money and material goods are usually the sort of items involved, but we may have slandered someone’s name or hurtfully deceived a person, and now we must correct those wrongs. If it is simply not possible to make amends for genuine reasons, we can talk to God and He will clear our conscience, because He sees that we want to restore but literally cannot. Restitution does not save us, no, but it is a sign that a person is indeed saved and is following the way of Christ. Zacchaeus made restitution without being told to do so, because genuine repentance and salvation had come into his heart through an encounter with Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour.','2019-10-31 12:54:19');
(138, 91,'The cost of restitution is high and this is why you must be careful of the foundation that you are laying today. Avoid things that you will regret tomorrow. Can you imagine a Christian who is progressing in his career using a false date of birth is exposed when he gets to the peak of his career through another document he never knew existed. Are we going to say this is the work of the devil or the person’s failure to address issues when they should? Live a glorious Christian life in all purity, transparency and decency because when the demand of restitution comes, it comes at a cost. This is the time to settle your foundational errors before they rise to attack tomorrow. ','2019-10-31 12:55:19');
(139, 92,'A Christian that is living in sin, fear and torment is just existing without fulfilling the divine agenda for his/her life. One of the dangers of living without the authority of Christ as a believer is that such person may end up in hell because our authority in Christ is a complete package that involves power over sin, self and all the activities of the enemies. Such Christians may not be able to overcome sin and therefore end up in hell fire. The secret of success in life is embedded in the authority given to us in Christ Jesus.','2019-10-31 12:55:19');
(140, 92,'The keys of the kingdom of heaven are already in our hands and God expects us to bind and loose, He expects us to rule and dominate. The initial plan of God for Adam that was lost in the garden of Eden has been reactivated and restored. It is back and better and in a better package for us as New Testament believers and we have to fully maximize this golden opportunity. Any child of God that is not using his/her authority in Christ is a prodigal son and he/she is not even worthy to be called a servant of God, talk less of a child. It is time to arise and take our place in the kingdom.','2019-10-31 12:56:19');
(141, 93,'God wants us to know His will. He only requires that we become willing to do things His way as He reveals them to us. As we saw in the study, the first step is to come into obedience and agreement with His written Word. Jesus emphasised obedience to His Father’s will. If we are not willing to obey what is written in His Word, then He will not be willing to reveal His more specific plans for our individual lives.','2019-10-31 12:57:19');
(142, 93,'God has a will or plan for our lives. We are not a mistake; we are God's master plan. Predestined and called for specific purpose from the foundation of the earth. Also, God is interested in every aspects of our lives and He has a plan for each of them. So, we must know and be sure that it is the will of God to reveal His will and plan to us','2019-10-31 12:58:19');
(143, 93,'We must also be willing to surrender our will in order to do what God wants. Even Jesus said, “Not my will but thine be done”. We must surrender our own plans in order to follow His. Who you want to marry may not be right for you?  Or what you want to study in school, or what kind of business you want to open, etc. Allow God to lead your life and you will get the best results. It is not every open door that is yours; hence, the need to build a spiritual life that can relate and hear with God.','2019-10-31 12:59:19');
(144, 93,'God does not want us to live in confusion and uncertainty. Learn to trust God for His best and build an intimacy with Him whereby you can ask Him how He wants you to use the gifts and talents He has given you. Ask Him questions about each area of your life and He will give you direction.','2019-10-31 12:59:19');
(145, 95,'Many of us live busy lives. We hear all sorts of voices each day from people around us and from electronic media. Hearing God’s voice in the midst of all the clamour will require deliberate action on our part. He will not compete with other voices to get our attention, especially if we are already born-again after He has called us out of the old way of life. If we value His guidance, then we will seek it at all cost. We will go the extra mile. He has given us His written word as a primary guide. For more specific decision-making, we will need to hear from Him on that particular circumstance so we can know what to do.','2019-10-31 13:00:19');
(146, 95,'Do not be like those who fast and pray to hear God because there is a problem or because there is a decision to be made. Let it be a daily experience and not an emergency action. Don’t be like those who will go on seven days marathon or visit a prayer mountain, even when they have not maintained a daily quiet time for months and years. They are emergency solution seekers and not a sheep that the great shepherd is leading.  ','2019-10-31 13:01:19');
(147, 95,'A major thing we must practice is setting time apart when we can totally focus on God in prayers and study of His word. It is this type of discipline that helps us to learn how to tell the difference between our own voice, the voice of the enemy, and that special “still small voice” which comes from God alone.','2019-10-31 13:02:19');
(148, 95,'We must also be aware that God is willing to use other avenues to communicate with us, including dreams, prophets, and even inner witness. Jesus said the pure in heart will see God (Matt. 5:8), so our inward purity is a critical factor if we must hear God speak to us. Getting a word from God can be the difference between a high-quality decision or a disastrous decision in important areas of life. It will serve the Christian well to regularly tune into the Lord’s frequency as a regular way of life. Knowing how to recognise God’s voice will help us in building a strong foundation in our relationship with Him. We will not be deceived or misled if we invest the time needed to learn how to hear and know God when He speaks to us.','2019-10-31 13:02:19');
(149, 96,'In this study, we have discovered that the very first thing to do in becoming a disciple of our Lord Jesus is to be born again. As soon as a man is born again, he is expected to enrol in a discipleship relationship with Jesus. Also, we are to take the yoke upon our necks and be ready to follow Jesus. The only thing that makes yoke-bearing easy is a willing submission unto the leadership of the Lord in our lives. Bearing our cross connotes willingly sacrificing ourselves for the things of God. A sacrifice has to cost the offerer something or it would not be a sacrifice.','2019-10-31 13:03:19');
(150, 96,'Remember, when you enter into a discipleship relationship with Jesus, He will endure with you until you become what He wants you to be.','2019-10-31 13:03:19');
(151, 98,'One of the major ship that will convey true Christians to the shore of the kingdom of God is discipleship. It is a consistent, continual and continuous relationship with God and it has to be measurable, progressive, productive and fruitful. All the children of God must submit themselves and be enrolled in the school of discipleship where you can play a dual role as a student and a lecturer at the same time. They will be making disciples of others as they are being discipled It is a core course that one cannot afford to carry.','2019-10-31 13:04:19');
(152, 98,'As we follow Christ and also climb the shoulders of fathers and mothers that are following Christ, our lives will continue to produce like people and from generations to generations, Christ like people and not just religious people will be born and made into the kingdom. If you refuse to bear fruits and make disciples of others, then, you are a prodigal child of God and a waster of divine investments. God will be disappointed in you and he will pack such people aside to recruit men that will not be fruitless and barren.','2019-10-31 13:05:19');
(153, 99,'The whole essence of life is to live for God. To surrender all at the feet of the son of God who died for us. If He gave His life for us, nothing should be too big for us to let go for Him. He expects us to spend every time and moment of our lives pleasing Him and satisfying His intentions.','2019-10-31 13:06:19');
(154, 99,'If anything is too big for you to let go, you need to go back to Calvary and rededicate your life to God and drop everything on the altar. God can ask for anything from us as His children. Abraham our father has laid a good example for us when he laid his Isaac on the altar.','2019-10-31 13:08:19');
(155, 99,'A surrendered, consecrated, sanctified, holy, obedient lifestyle that exemplifies that attributes of Christ is the greatest worship that you can give to God!','2019-10-31 13:10:19');
(156, 100,'As many as are led by the Spirit, they are the sons of God (Rom. 8:14), and you can only be led when you take a walk with the Spirit of God. Our lives depend on this for without Him we are nothing. The foundation of our Christian faith starts and ends with the Spirit of God for through Him we were saved, and through Him we are currently sealed till the day of showing forth. He has a lot to reveal to us. Our Lord Jesus said, “He will guide us into all truth”. Not walking in Him is like someone doing scuba diving without an oxygen tank. Instant obedience to the promptings of the Spirit endears us to Him more and more, and also allows Him to reveal more truth to us. Let’s lay hold on this important part of our Christian foundation by deliberately walking in the Spirit every day of our lives.','2019-10-31 13:11:19');

(1, 1, 'During this period, the city of Ephesus was the fourth largest and was well known as a centre of trade, as well as diversity of cultures, art, and religion. The native Ephesians were strongly devoted to and worshipped the goddess Artemis (or Diana in Latin; e.g., Acts 19:27, 35). The magnificent temple of Artemis was included among the seven wonders of the world at that time. For this reason, many locals were enraged at Paul when he came into their city preaching the “one true God,” as a result of financial loss among the silversmiths who made idols. But other than the faithful followers of Diana, Ephesus was also filled with various spiritualists, including wizards, soothsayers, sorcerers, and astrologers. Some men and women from these groups might have believed the Gospel that Paul preached (Acts 19:18–19), but mixed the truth of God with their former religious practices. Such practice would naturally lead to false doctrines infiltrating the newly converted Ephesian church, with these false teachers combining the doctrines of Christ with their own doctrines thereby confusing and misleading the “young” church. For an average Yoruba, you can recall the concept of, “Igbagbo o ni ka ma s’oro,” meaning, “Christianity is not against traditional religion.” This error is something we must avoid, as we seek to offer reasonable service unto God.', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(2, 1, 'In his epistle to the Ephesians, Paul strongly emphasised how Jesus is God the Son, and how He is above all principality and power and any name that is named (Eph. 1:21). He also stated blatantly that the Father was together with the Son in the creation of the universe (Eph. 3:9). The purpose of such statements was to let the believers fully understand that Jesus is not another “god,” or another school of thought, as many of these had begun to pollute the church. He encouraged them to not follow what the other Gentiles did, “in the vanity of their mind” (Eph. 4:17). We are called to put on the whole armour of God to successfully stand against the “wiles” (deceptions, falsehoods, trickery) of the devil (Eph. 6:11), which includes, among other things, false doctrines and philosophies from deceptive teachers.', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(3, 1, 'Paul was not going to leave this church under heavy enemy attack; so when he had to continue his tour of the churches he made sure his trusted and faithful “son” remained with them as long as necessary. Can we be trusted to raise the standard of God, especially when others are not there with us?', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(4, 2, 'Paul and Timothy’s relationship emphasised why we need people around us in our quest to serve God reasonably. Paul had a great team of fellow labourers and associates in the Gospel. One of his most cherished relationships was the one he had with Timothy (or Timotheos, meaning “dear to God”), the young disciple from Lystra. Timothy had earned himself a positive reputation among the congregation in Lystra and Iconium (Acts 16:2). He was also very young, possibly still in his teens when he met Paul, and the great apostle might have seen him as someone willing to humbly learn and be an apprentice. His mixed Jewish and Greek background was also appealing to Paul’s own background and personality. The combination of these factors led to an awesome relationship of love, respect, and trust, which ultimately became a kind of father-son experience, as Paul continually mentioned (1 Cor. 4:17, Phil. 2:22, 1 Tim. 1:2, 18, 2 Tim. 1:2).', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(5, 2, 'Building strong relationships such as that of Timothy and Paul is necessary for many reasons in our service to the Lord. For example, Paul needed someone he could rely on to safeguard the Ephesian church from false teachers. Without a strong bond, communion, and understanding, he would be so unsure as to who was suitable for this particular job. Even though Timothy was very young and even shy, Paul knew he was strong in the Scriptures and in the Spirit (2 Tim. 1:6–7, 3:15); therefore, he was equipped to handle the task. In addition, Paul knew he did not have anybody else like Timothy who would genuinely care for the overall well-being of the churches (e.g., Phil. 2:20).', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(6, 2, 'Timothy, on the other hand, needed a mentor like Paul. There was much to learn in Christ after salvation, and Paul became the spiritual “father” that Timothy never had (his natural father being a Greek). He was more than happy and willing to learn from and serve such a person who had been handpicked by the Lord Himself to be an ambassador of the Gospel to both the Jews and the Gentiles (Acts 9:15). No doubt, Timothy’s “reasonable service” to the Lord was greatly enhanced by his relationship and partnership with Paul. As a TACEFite, you need a discipler and a mentor who will help you maximise your potential in the path of reasonable service. Let us not be a lone ranger or a fatherless saint, struggling to grow alone or jumping from one spiritual covering to another. We need long-term submission to a leadership and discipleship programme to be able to come out great in the journey to the Promised Land.', '2018-02-17 17:57:44'),
(7, 3, 'After the introductory greeting, Paul shows that his young protégé (Timothy) had an obligation to make sure the church was guarded against teachers who were not conveying the wholesome doctrine of Christ, but misleading believers with their personal versions of truth. Paul understood the consequences of falsehoods being fed to the flock. Healthy meals lead to a healthy body; but the opposite is also true. Spiritually, holding false information in your heart and mind keeps one blinded from reality and can ultimately lead to spiritual death. This is one of the major reasons why false teaching is so dangerous—it leads to living incorrectly and ultimately to destruction (temporal or, if not corrected, eternal).', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(8, 3, 'God has appointed teachers in his church (Eph. 4:11–12) to educate his people about sin, judgement, salvation, redemption, His kingdom, the power of His Spirit, and other necessary realities. Unfortunately, as predicted by Paul in Acts 20:29–30, “grievous wolves” have found their ways into the congregation, with their personal agendas and false teachings. This has done great damage to the body of Christ worldwide.', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(9, 3, 'Today, we now have hyper-grace gospel that says, once-saved-ever-saved, which means sinners will go to heaven. They are turning the Bible upside down and taking the grace of God as a license to live their lives anyhow. We must avoid erroneous teachings such as this.', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(10, 4, 'Verse 4 of our study text speaks of fables, genealogies, and “questions.” What Paul was telling Timothy “to pay no attention to” in this verse is in reference to Jewish teachers of that time who had mixed the Law of Moses with their own vain traditions. Remember that this was the same era (first century A.D.) as the Pharisees, who the Lord Jesus had to correct on many occasions concerning the false teachings which they had intertwined into the God-given Mosaic Law (Matt. 15:7-9).', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(11, 4, 'The “fables” (Greek muthos = myth or fiction) refer to those teachings held by a good percentage of rabbis before and during the first century, which hijacked the Scriptures and twisted them into fairy tales. An example of this is the Book of Jubilees (written around 100 B.C.) which takes the historic account of events from Genesis and perverts them with untrue tales of mythology. Fable is also when a minister comes to the podium and relies on the latest movies he watched on African Magic which are based on mythology, tradition, and mysticism to preach. This is wrong! When did the altar become the platform for comedy, fantasy, and reinforcement of witchcraft? When did the altar become the opportunity to trigger fear in the hearts of people by emphasising the power of the devil through traditional African stories that de-emphasise the finished work of Calvary?', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(12, 4, 'Paul was letting Timothy see that the fables and endless genealogies will only produce speculations as to what is actually true and what is not. When it comes to foundational doctrines, it is not the will of God for His people to grope about in the dark and speculate about things. He gave the church the Holy Scriptures back then as He has delivered them to us now. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path,” so said the psalmist (Ps. 119:105). It is by rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15) that we can correctly hold fast to what is sound doctrine while disposing off the toxic teachings.', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(13, 5, 'Instead of entertaining the twisted interpretations of the law by the false teachers, Timothy was informed by Paul (1 Tim. 1:5) that the whole purpose of the law was to bring the disciple to the place of sincere, genuine love for God and man. The Lord Jesus has said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15). The LORD also made the same direct connection between loving Him and keeping His commandments (Exod. 20:6). The Lord Jesus hang all the law on two commandments (Matt. 22:40), which are to love God wholly (Deut. 6:5) and to love neighbour as thyself (Lev. 19:18). Those who love God obey Him. In fact, those who claim to know God but refrain from keeping His commandments are liars (1 John 2:4).', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(14, 5, 'Paul emphasised that this charity can only come from a heart that is pure; and also from a good conscience and sincere faith. The word conscience is a very strong Greek word suneidesis, which means a co-perception (i.e., moral consciousness). The “co-” in the meaning of the word means that only two people are aware of your innermost thoughts—the two people are you and God. A good conscience means the person has made up his mind to think according to God’s will, as “he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17). This conviction, along with a pure heart and sincere faith, is how a person attains the “end of the commandment”—love. And this is not the worldly kind of love, by the way, but the selfless, spiritual love that has the interest of the other person at heart—sacrificing one’s own comfort for the welfare of the other. This kind of love is what God wants us to have toward each other. May we get there in the Lord Jesus’ name. Amen.', '2018-02-17 18:03:40'),
(15, 6, 'The Jewish false teachers had obviously misapplied the Mosaic Law. One of the ways which they did this was by teaching that observing the Law (including the ceremonial rituals) was necessary for one’s salvation, even while acknowledging the redemptive work of Christ. An example is found in Acts 15, where some teachers were peddling the doctrine that unless believers were circumcised and kept the Law, they could not be saved (Acts 15:1, 5). However, they did not have the true revelation that “by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in [God’s] sight” (Rom. 3:20). Verse 9 of our study text shows us that the Law is not made for a “righteous man.” The righteous man in this sense is he who has come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus, the kind of faith that causes him to repent from sin—making up his mind to follow and obey the Lord. Such a person need not be told not to do the kinds of things listed in verses 9–10. He already knows and His new nature cannot operate in that domain again on a continued basis. In addition, the ceremonial rituals of the Law were for Israel under the old covenant, so it was a misapplication for these Pharisees to impose them on the church.  ', '2018-02-17 18:09:19'),

The average person has little idea of just how holy God is. In fact, some prophets of old were shocked and even terrified at the presence of God’s spotless perfection and holiness. God does not plainly reveal Himself to all mankind; otherwise, there would not be any need for faith. God wants us to love Him by choice, not out of fear. But He has revealed His holiness in the Law so that we can see that all have sinned and come short of His glory (Rom. 3:23). This conviction is what leads us to Christ, as we see how desperately we need Him. Nobody has ever kept God’s law of righteousness to perfection, but the Lord Jesus did—and now He is the only means by which sinful man can be redeemed. God’s Word says that the “law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith” (Gal. 3:24).', '2018-02-17 18:09:19'),
(19, 7, 'As used in verses 9 and 10 of our study text, the word translated as “sound” is the Greek hugiain? which literally means to be “healthy.” In other words, the spiritual health of the church is directly dependent on our observation of sound, healthy teaching and instruction. Therefore, “unsound” doctrine will also lead to an unhealthy and spiritually diseased church. As mentioned in the previous week, one of the greatest errors in doctrine in our generation is the belief and teaching of some that since Christ has fully paid the price for our sins, we are under “grace” and guaranteed a place in His kingdom regardless of how we live. This unhealthy doctrine belittles the necessity of obedience and holiness, and negates what the Lord said (Matt. 7:21). Because of such doctrine, many “Christians” come to Christ not for a real relationship and partnership, but just for what they can receive materially to live a “happy” life. No wonder the church today is so weak, and some misrepresents who God really is. Unwholesome doctrine produces anaemic and backsliding believers, but teaching the full Gospel in truth produces spiritually strong men and women of God.', '2018-02-17 18:09:19'),

He further emphasised this in 2 Corinthians 3:7–18, where he indeed says that the Law was also glorious, but (in verse 10) that the glory of the Gospel “excels” (Greek huperball? = “surpass”). Hebrews 8:6 again shows that the new covenant is “better” than the former, and carries better promises.

(23, 10, 'Apostle Paul would never have gone down in history today as one of the most important servants of God of all time, if not for the enabling mercy of the Lord. The word “enabled” in verse 12 is the Greek endunamoo which means “to empower,” and is derived from a well-known Greek word dunamis—endowment of power. Paul acknowledged he was once “a blasphemer” (1 Tim. 1:13). He admitted he was “a persecutor” recalling how he oppressed the believers, even consenting to the death of Stephen. But one thing about Paul is that he was zealous thinking what he was doing was the best way to serve the God of his father. But in spite of his zeal towards God, he was not yet “enabled” to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, or see that the Law and the prophets whom he loved so much actually pointed to the Lord Jesus as Messiah. This was where the mercy of God had to step in. It took an explicit manifestation and proclamation of the Lord Himself (Acts 9:5) to turn his unbelief to saving faith. This is why we must continue to pray for the mercy of God who opens the eyes of sinners unto salvation—it is the foundation of a true encounter with the One true God, beyond the shackles of religion.', '2018-02-17 18:13:30'),
(24, 11, 'Paul spoke of the grace of God being “exceeding abundant” (1 Tim. 1:14). This phrase is translated from the word huperpleonaz?, which means to not only be abundant but superabundant, that is, far more than abundant. He was saying that he was so deep in unbelief and spiritual blindness, but God’s grace was more than sufficient to pull him out into deliverance and salvation. Many people, in times past and presently, have felt that they have gone too far (drowned) in sin and ungodliness, and that there is no way God could ever accept or forgive them after all they have done. Paul used his salvation experience to show such people that God’s grace in the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is far more than enough to not only forgive them, but also enable them to become powerful ministers of God. This is what he meant in verse 16 when he spoke of himself being a “pattern” [hupotup?sis = “a sketch for imitation”] that the Lord used to show His patience and superabundant grace upon sinners. This understanding must encourage our hearts as repairers of the breach, especially the knowledge that no one is too bad or too sinful to the point that he cannot be saved.

(25, 12, 'It is a beautiful thing to know that the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Paul most assuredly acknowledged this in verse 15, but also stated that he is “chief” among sinners. The word rendered as chief is the Greek protos which means foremost or first. Paul spoke with deep sense of gratitude of how he appreciated his salvation. We can tell from similar statements where he claimed to be “less than the least of all saints” (Eph. 3:8) or where he professed to be “the least of the apostles” (1 Cor. 15:9). These statements showed humility, mainly because he always remembered how he persecuted the precious believers of his Lord and Saviour, and, therefore, felt a sense of unworthiness. But this “chief” of sinners also became the chief of servants, as he himself testified in the verse that immediately followed. So even though he said he was the least of the apostles because of his crimes against the church, he also (truthfully) stated he laboured more abundantly than they did (1 Cor. 15:10).

There is reason to believe that there is a further connection with the “gift” which was in Timothy by the prophecies and laying on hands of the elders in those cities (1 Tim. 4:14). God must have begun to show those around Timothy that something was special about him and that he was set apart for a very special ministry. Clearly, the future of the young brother Timothy was birthed in the womb of prophecy.

In addition, there is great importance in unwritten prophecies, which God gives to forewarn and prepare His people for a specific event. For example, in Acts 11:27-30, the Spirit revealed to Agabus that there would be a great famine throughout the world, and the prophecy came to pass during the reign of Claudius Caesar. Here, God used a prophecy through Agabus to inform His people in order to  prepare themselves against famine, just as how He revealed Pharaoh’s dream to Joseph for a similar reason (Gen. 41).', '2018-02-17 18:20:43'),

(36, 15, 'The next exhortation to Timothy is “holding faith” and “a good conscience.” The combination of these two virtues results in what is called integrity, which is also defined as moral soundness. It is a conviction of what is right, and the determination to follow and do what is right. A person may have faith, but lack “good conscience.” God’s Word says it is not enough to believe (even demons believe), but faith must be complemented by works (James 2:19-20). It is of no benefit to know the truth but not act in accordance. “Holding” in Greek means to hold, but more specifically to “possess”. We must possess faith and a good conscience. This means that regardless of the situation we find ourselves, we must continue to operate in faith—faith must become who we are at all times; we must possess faith and also be possessed by faith! A good conscience works together with faith to bring God’s approval, and the enemy will not be able to stand against our lives and ministry under these circumstances.', '2018-02-17 18:20:43'),

They went from being backsliders to becoming Christ’s enemies who opposed the faith. Hymenaeus is probably the same person mentioned in 2 Timothy 2:17–18, and Alexander is probably the coppersmith mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:14–15. These men were both known to blaspheme. In the first passage mentioned above, it was said that Hymenaeus had erred from the truth and even overthrew the faith of some by teaching that the resurrection and rapture had already passed. In the second passage, Paul said that Alexander did him much evil, and “greatly withstood our words.” This signifies that he was teaching things contrary to Paul’s words and doctrine.', '2018-02-17 18:20:43'),
(40, 17, 'But what did Paul mean by saying he had delivered them unto Satan? Well, this same expression was  used by the apostle in 1 Corinthians 5:5, concerning the case of a fornicator. In this case, Paul said that the delivering unto Satan was for the purpose of “the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” So he is most likely doing the same to Hymenaeus and Alexander for the same reason. The point is that Satan is the god of this world (2 Cor. 4:4)—the ungodly world is his domain. If a fellow Christian is in error, there is a step-by-step procedure to correct the problem according to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 18:15-17. If the erring Christian refuses to receive correction from you alone, then the matter should be presented before two or three witnesses; if he still refuses, then the matter should be presented before the church. If he refuses to hear the church, then he should be rejected and seen as a worldly unbeliever. Now Paul did not intend for the erring Christian to be lost forever, but that he should feel the pain of being excommunicated from the church so that he may return later in acknowledgment of his error (2 Thess. 3:14-15). This is what he means by “the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus” (1 Cor. 5:5). Hymenaeus and Alexander would only be received back into the Ephesian church if they acknowledged their error and turned in repentance. This same principle still applies today. Blasphemy and teaching of false doctrines should not be overlooked in the church, but should be handled according to the Lord Jesus’ words (Matt. 18:15–17). Better to receive correction now and be saved later when the time comes to meet the Lord; than to continue in error and eventually hear him say “depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.”', '2018-02-17 18:20:43'),

He confessed, “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do . . .” (John 5:19). His whole life and ministry was marked by prayer. He prayed at His baptism which officially kicked off his public ministry (Luke 3:21–22). Sometimes He prayed all night before making critical decisions (Luke 6:12–13). He prayed before He ate (Luke 9:16, 22:19). The Lord Jesus prayed in connection with the simplest, commonest events of everyday life. Two of His own disciples did not even recognize Him after His resurrection, until they recognized the way He habitually prayed before breaking bread (Luke 24:30–31). He prayed before great temptations (Luke 22:40-43) and instructed His disciples to pray to avoid being tempted (Luke 20:40, Matt. 6:13). He interceded for Peter (Luke 22:31–32) and for all His disciples (John 17:11–20). He even interceded for the same people who condemned Him to death (Luke 23:34). His last words before death was a prayer (Luke 23:46), a fitting way to “end” a life marked by constant communion with God. Now, if the Lord Jesus the Master “could do nothing of Himself” but maintained communion with the Father, then it should be obvious that His servants need to do this even more!

This is what the Lord Jesus did in John 11:41–44, when He raised Lazarus from the dead. He thanked God in advance, knowing that the prayer was already answered.', '2018-02-17 18:28:09'),

The two Greek words translated as “all men” literally means all human beings. Paul then continued to emphasise that the only way human beings can be saved is through the Lord Jesus, the Mediator (1 Tim. 2:5–7). “Therefore”, he says, “I want men to PRAY everywhere” (v.8).

Church history has it that Nero captured Christians and dipped them in oil before setting them on fire in his garden at night as a source of light. When the great fire of Rome broke out and burned for five days, Nero accused Christians and ordered that they be thrown to dogs, crucified, or burned.

Paul said this is how the Christians would obtain a quiet and peaceable life (1 Tim. 2:2). The word “quiet” denotes we are not troubled from without, while “peaceable” infers we are not troubled from within.

This goddess was known to have elevated the position of a woman to a level that contradicted Biblical standard of submission, especially for converts who were just leaving Artemis for the true God. It was, therefore, easy to appreciate Paul’s specific instruction on how to manage women who were liberated and empowered to control men because of the spiritual influence they received from their worship of Artemis, in a manner similar to the worship of Aphrodite in Corinth—another church to which similar instruction was given.<br/>\r\nThe Ephesian women wore fancy hair braids and decorated themselves with jewellery and ornate clothes as they prayed to Artemis. History indicates that their locks of hairs carry their prayers; hence, this was an issue in the church as it negated the fundamental place of Christ, as the new converts found it difficult to differentiate between their new life and the old idol worship. In addition, while no sacrifices were done to Artemis, the women worshipped Artemis with their clothing, jewellery, and their words.<br/>\r\nThese broad contexts will be useful as we attempt to understand why Paul gave instructions on women silence and issues of jewellery in subsequent studies.', '2018-02-17 18:37:51'),

The temple had just been built, and all Israel was gathered together at the dedication of the house of God. As the leader of Israel, Solomon had the responsibility of being the one to lead in corporate prayer. In the Christian home today, God has also appointed men to be the leader and custodians of the spiritual welfare of the family. The spiritual state of a man, therefore, determines the state of a Christian home. A man who is in close relationship with God is in a good position to properly guide and direct his house. On the other hand, one who is unstable in his relationship with God will make many bad decisions that damage the well-being of the family. We can say that the man is also the spiritual breadwinner, who must spiritually watch over and pastor his home as a mini church for the Lord. God has made the man to be the foundation upon which the whole house is built. So while women and children play critical roles in the success of the family, the house is still sure to fall without a proper foundation.', '2018-02-17 18:37:51'),

This is not saying that women should not dress well and take good care of themselves, neither is it saying that braiding hair or wearing jewellery is forbidden by God. The braiding that Paul was speaking about here is what harlots in Ephesus do as acts of worship to Artemis. The spirit behind the words is that godly women should not emphasise these things, but instead set their focus on pleasing God inwardly and by good works outwardly. There must be a godly balance between inward and outward beauty. Dressing, hairdo, and any ornaments should be adorned with moderation in a manner acceptable to God, while the major focus of the woman should be fulfilling her God-given duties and responsibilities.', '2018-02-17 18:37:51'),

In the same letter to the Roman church, he also mentioned a woman named Junia (Rom. 16:7), whom he described as “fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles.” Also, we know that Joel’s prophecy that was fulfilled in Acts 2:17 was for sons and daughters.', '2018-02-17 18:37:51'),

No sane person would invest huge amount of his time, energy, and resources into something in which he sees no value. For example, a medical student who spends as much as eight to ten years in the medical school, studying very hard the whole time, does so because he knows his efforts are not in vain, which gives him motivation to keep going as he keeps his eyes on the prize. The athlete will also train hard for long hours each day and eat proper diet, all the time thinking about the gold medal he will receive if he is diligent enough.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),

So Paul kept his body under and brought it into subjection; otherwise, he would lose the eternal, “incorruptible” prize and ended up being a castaway.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(118, 35, 'Our journey to heaven requires a walk of godliness—a consistent walk to become like God. Of course, we may miss our steps here and there, at different times, hence a need to exercise and discipline ourselves, until it becomes a way of life. A marathon race runner can run for one hour, nonstop without feeling anything afterwards. However, if someone who has not had any form of exercise in the last six months tries to do only 30 minutes of jogging around, he will be forced to spend the next one week nursing muscle wound and body pains because he has not exercised himself on a consistent basis. However, if he continues to discipline himself on a consistent basis with similar exercise, his muscles and body system will become adjusted to this new life. This is the same reality for us as Christians. <b>We only become what we consistently exercise ourselves unto.</b> If we exercise our tongue to always say the truth, it will just become naturally difficult for any form of lies to come out of our mouth. If we discipline our mind to always meditate on the Scripture on a consistent basis, it will be difficult for a lustful thought to find a space to grow, and if we are consistent in praying daily for definite period of time or time of the day, we will get to a point that it becomes our normal way of life – without any stress or being bored.

We must have regular spiritual exercises in godliness to build our spiritual immunity and strengthen our spiritual muscles to stand firm. Below are some fundamental spiritual building blocks that we must exercise ourselves unto.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(120, 36, 'a)	<b>Bible study.</b> The Bible is God’s revelation of Himself to mankind. It contains the will of God for His people. Studying God’s Word with an obedient heart is the beginning of being in agreement with His will. His word pushes us towards godliness by “sanctifying” us (John 17:17). Needless to say, it is impossible for a Christian to grow without ingesting God’s Word (1 Pet. 2:2).', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(121, 36, 'b)	<b>Prayer.</b> Communication with God is done through prayer. We hear from God mainly through the Bible, and we talk to God in prayer. Paul said we should pray with all kinds of prayer and supplication in the Spirit (Eph. 6:18). Moreover, the Bible teaches that we can pray in tongues, pray with singing, and even pray with unutterable groanings through the Spirit. Prayer should not just be a fellowship affair or special vigils. It must be a daily exercise to build our spiritual stamina, sufficient to withstand the reality of the daily temptations.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(122, 36, 'c)	<b>Meditation.</b> Deep thinking in the Word of God is called meditation. We have to ask ourselves how God’s Word and Biblical truths apply to our practical lives. First Timothy 4:15 says, “Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them.” This is how we are transformed by the renewing of our minds (Rom. 12:2). After Moses died and Joshua was about to lead Israel into possessing the Promised Land, God’s main instruction to Joshua was not to carnally prepare for war by sharpening swords or attending to other tasks. His main instruction was for Joshua to meditate in the Word of God day and night (Josh. 1:8). Nobody can go far in godly discipline without meditating on God’s Word continually and applying those thoughts to every area of life.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(123, 36, 'd)	<b>Fasting.</b> Abstinence from food and refusing to fulfil any ungodly desire of the flesh are the essential practices of fasting. Both forms of fasting are needed to break the power of the flesh over us and to be grounded in the things of the Spirit. This is similar to an athlete denying himself of fatty, sugary, and high-calorie foods; opting instead to exercise discipline and do what is more beneficial for his body. The Lord Jesus has said that some kinds of demons cannot be cast out except by the combination of “prayer and fasting” (Mark 9:29). He also said that those who fast unto the Father will be rewarded openly (Matt 6:18). Spiritual maturity is attained quicker as we learn and apply the principle of fasting.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(124, 36, 'e)	<b>Preaching the Gospel.</b> Every person that has been saved by the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has a responsibility to communicate that same life-saving message to others. Even if a person has been saved for several years, every time he preaches the Gospel to others he is reminded that he is only saved by the grace of God through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ. His personal sanctification and growing godliness over the years are a by-product of his salvation and God’s training. This helps him to see his dependency on God’s grace and, therefore, draws him even closer to God. Preaching the Gospel not only save the hearer but also strengthens godliness in the preacher by drawing him closer to God.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(125, 36, 'f)	<b>Christian fellowship.</b> No Christian is an island. God’s Word shows us that the members of Christ’s body need one another (1 Cor. 12:21). We are not to forsake the assembly of one another, but we are to exhort and encourage one another (Heb. 10:25). As we exhort one another, we grow our spiritual muscles, just as iron sharpens iron, according to Proverbs 27:17. No single Christian has all the gifts of the Spirit, but God has distributed them among the members of the body. We must minister our gifts to one another and increase in strength thereby.', '2018-02-17 20:17:17'),
(126, 37, 'We will start our study from the last verse of our text because of its importance in the whole passage. In verse 16, Paul said to Timothy, “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.” To break it up properly, he was saying: (a) take heed to thyself and (b) take heed to the doctrine.', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),

From there, we take heed to the doctrine, representing our work for Christ. Our walk with Christ is the necessary basis and foundation for our work for Christ. In other words, a great ministry is dependent on a great relationship with God. As we grow and become more filled with Christ, the joyous reflection of our ministry spills over to the people we encounter, and this is what ministry is about. Ministry is not activities, but the outpour of the life of God in us. If we do not have consistent relationship with the Lord where He pours Himself into us, we have no ministry, no matter how recognised or popular we are as a title carrier. This same principle is found in Acts 20:28, where Paul told the Ephesian elders, “Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock…” They were to ensure they were in good standing with God (their walk), and then translate this to shepherd the flock (their work).', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),
(128, 37, 'It is when we first take heed to our personal relationship and communion with the Lord that He imparts into our spirit what we need to take heed to our ministry. Anybody who claims to serve the Lord Jesus Christ but does not have a good relationship with Him is not serving Christ but themselves, possibly for money, fame, or some other selfish motive. “All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s” is the reason Paul gave for his confidence in sending Timothy alone to the Philippians (Phil. 2:19-21). He knew that Timothy’s walk was genuinely developed to support his work. As a people called unto reasonable service, we must understand that it is completely unreasonable to work for God without a walk with Him. It is like a driver leading people through a road he does not know at all.', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),
(129, 38, 'One of Timothy’s challenges as a servant of God was that he was very young and shy. He is like that brother who will see people misbehaving in the fellowship and would not have the boldness to correct and put everyone under the weight of God’s grace. He is that executive or subgroup leader who allows error, indolence, or unseriousness, among other things, to persist because he lacks the ability to take charge and correct with divine influence. Timothy type of leaders cannot confront issues. They always push things under the carpet until they degenerate to points of utter mess. They always shy away into their shell when leadership actions are much needed to put things in order with all sense of gravity. They will see other members or even leaders who come late to fellowship without reason or those who indulge in bad attitude and they will rather be silent or even withdraw from any frontal engagement. They are good at reaction and not at action. They will watch symptoms grow into full-blown spiritual disease that can destroy people’s lives and even weaken the standard of God in a fellowship. We see similar behaviour among couples, parent-to-children, partners, and even friends, when we shy away instead of acting responsibly.', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),
(130, 38, 'Oftentimes, the timidity of these types of people may be out of perceived self-gap or thinking less of themselves just like Timothy who thought his age was his limitation. We see instances where these kinds of leaders feel insufficient or incapacitated because they think those who they should lead or correct are more experienced, more learned, richer, or even more exposed than them. They forget that by virtue of being a spiritual leader in a position as a fellowship or subgroup leader, they are by grace higher in placement than any other human basis for classification.', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),
(131, 38, '<b>The fundamental principle here is that when you are called a leader, you must act as one. </b> When God trusts you to lead His people, rise beyond how you see yourself and enter into the consciousness of how God sees you as the “one in charge,” not by age, race, pace, place, or ace, but by grace.

(132, 38, 'This also speaks to the need for conscious character modification, so that we correct our personality gaps and be able to fit into the role that God has called us unto. For example, If we know we are bad in relationship or courtesy (e.g., we do not know how to greet, say thank you for gifts we have received, or we do not smile at people), then we must not spiritualise these as a generational curse or an uncorrectable flaw inherited from our upbringing. We must consciously correct these now before they discredit our ministry or diminish our ability to be an example of the believers who have been called unto reasonable service. Let us be careful that our personal character or weaknesses do not cut others off from the best of God that our ministry is meant to deliver.', '2018-02-17 20:34:50'),

God’s Word says that no corrupt communication should proceed out of our mouths, but only beneficial words that minister grace to the hearers (Eph. 4:29). This means there is no room for filthy talk, lying, gossip, dirty jokes, words of threat or revenge, murmuring, and so on.

If sin in a person’s life is never corrected, he might rationalise that sin, get hardened, and die in that state.

If our children were playing on a dangerous road without our knowledge, and another adult sees them in the path of danger but just shakes his head without correcting them, we will be angry if we find out that the person just allowed our children to continue playing on that dangerous road. If a Christian cares about the welfare of the brethren, then he will not allow them to continue on the dangerous path of sin and iniquity. This attitude of genuine love for others must be the foundation of every act of correction.

This is understandable nevertheless not a good excuse to allow someone to continue walking down a destructive path. The best way to remove the barrier of fear and go ahead to correct the person is by fearing God alone, and not man. We must realise that God will hold us accountable if we see someone heading for trouble and do not help such.

It wrongly assumes that we should close our eyes when we see our brethren fall into error. To accurately understand what the Lord was saying in this verse, we must read it further to verse 5 so as to understand the context. He was obviously saying that we cannot point out the speck in our brother’s eye when we have a plank in our own eye, that is, we are being hypocrites by pointing out someone else’s sin whereas our own sins are way greater.

Men who labour in doctrine prepare before they mount the podium and do not go there to teach about the story of tortoise that they watched on television. They are loaded with the right words and accurate in speaking the truth with boldness and sure impact. When sinners listen to them, they repent and when believers hear them, they renew their consecration. It is exciting when you see ministers who study (not just read) the entire Bible every year, which is also complemented with contemporary books to enhance the impact of their ministry. Ministry is “labour” according to our text and it is not a place for lazy people who failed out of other areas of life and think that it is the easy path to earn a living. No way!', '2018-02-19 12:20:04'),

(172, 47, 'When a church leader sins and does not repent but continues therein (e.g., in adultery, inappropriate use of church funds), the matter may eventually come out publicly even to the knowledge of the unbelieving secular world. This concern does not only damage the confidence and morale of the church or congregation, but the unsaved, who may have been thinking about turning to the Lord Jesus Christ, could also get discouraged and change their minds. It is, therefore, essential that church leadership should be kept godly and held accountable at all times.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),
(173, 47, 'Since some elders were already living in sin  in the Ephesian church, it was necessary for Paul to first remedy the existing problem, before talking about proper steps to take in selecting future leaders, so that only godly men were put into office and the chances of future scandals in leadership could be greatly reduced.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),
(174, 47, 'Paul said in verse 19 that any elder who is accused of any wrong should not be disciplined, unless at least two witnesses could testify and confirm the accusation. The process is to allow for transparency and fair hearing. This principle is derived from the Law of Moses (Deut. 19:15). We are aware of the satanic tactic of some people who may actually hate the minister for their own selfish reasons and thus arrange false witnesses to wrongfully accuse him and tarnish his reputation. The same situation happened to the Lord Jesus (Matt. 26:59–60). But Moses gave the solution (Deut. 19:16–20). The church council must follow what is written in verse 18, which is to “make diligent inquisition” concerning the claims of the witnesses and find the underlying cause of the matter. This is how to determine whether the accused leader is indeed guilty. As a church and fellowship, anything that is not based on proper evidence and proof should be dismissed, and no place must be allowed for rumour, hearsay, and gossip. Discernment of the spirit is very critical here when engaging the accused and the accuser. We have seen instances where there is no evidence, yet the Holy Spirit spoke expressly of a leader’s secret sins.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),
(175, 48, 'Those who are found guilty should be rebuked for everybody to see (1 Tim. 5:20). If a leader or an executive sins but the matter is kept secret for relevant reasons, the issue always boomerangs when such leaks out and becomes known among the congregation. It often breeds distrust in the church members towards their leaders. The process of public rebuke, however, does not mean we have to be too detailed in explaining what has happened, but to establish that something was done wrong by someone, who has been corrected and being helped to regain his spiritual momentum.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),

(178, 48, 'b)	Public rebuke causes others to become fearful of sinning (Deut. 19:20, 1 Tim. 5:20). If people know that church discipline will be administered without respect of persons, they will be fearful of becoming the object of such rebuke and will avoid sin.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),

(180, 49, 'In verse 21, Paul strongly charged Timothy (before God, the Lord Jesus, and the “elect” angels) that he should observe and implement his detailed instruction on transparent leadership correction without any form of partiality. It is very unrighteous when a man of high esteem is not properly rebuked but another less influential leader is thoroughly punished. The gathering of the children of God must not become a place of selective judgment with a sense of “untouchableness.” It is nothing but an act of injustice that can incur the wrath of God. Partiality is something that God warned Israel against and He Himself is not a “respecter of persons” (Lev. 19:15, Rom. 2:11).', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),
(181, 49, 'Indirect Biblical indications show Timothy had a tendency to be shy and timid. This may be the reason Paul charged him “before God” to execute justice without preference for personalities. As we have learnt in the previous weeks, we must not allow our personality deficiency or weakness to diminish the influence of our ministry. Shyness must not lead to a situation where partiality breeds because the leader is naturally shy and cannot face the high and mighty but can vent his anger on the lower class. In such case, Paul challenged Timothy to fear God and nobody else, regardless of how powerful or highly ranked the leader might be in age, class, experience, and wealth. It must never be said that he was unfair in judgement because he was of the same tribe as the accused or he was living free in the accused boy’s quarters. It becomes an error when an executive member of a fellowship fails to make right judgement on a matter because the parents of the affected individual are the ones paying his school fees.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),
(182, 50, 'Paul progressed further to give a future way to resolve the problems of wrong leadership practice. He instructed that to reduce the chances of any leader bringing ridicule to the name of the Lord through a scandalous living, Timothy must understand what to look out for before making selections. In verse 22, he charged Timothy to “lay hands suddenly on no man” that he must not hastily approve or ordain anyone into an office or else he will become “partaker of other men’s sins” having appointed unqualified people who ridicule the name of the Lord.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),

(185, 50, 'In the same vein, Paul called for continuous monitoring and supervision. He explained why we must carefully observe the lives of potential candidates for church leadership. In verses 24–25, he noted that some men’s sins are public knowledge and church members already know these kinds of people, while the sins of some are not immediately known but show forth in due time. The idea is that a leader must be elected only after long-term observation of their lives and personalities, since some people’s true nature might not be accurately determined immediately.

We are called to glorify God in our body” (1st Cor. 6:20). It is a wrong leadership lifestyle to continue to labour without careful awareness of the state of our bodies (this is not an obsession with our bodies). In verse 23 of this text, Paul urged Timothy to use a little wine for an apparent stomach ailment that he had. Note that Paul said, “a little” wine, whose intent is purely for medicinal purpose. Be aware that this is not a free pass for a Christian to consume alcohol, as some have twisted the Bible for their selfish interest. Paul was directing the young minister, Timothy, to manage his personal health through a harmless, acceptable method. Why will a Christian minister continue a retinue of repeated period of ministrations when his body signals are not favourable? Why will a brother who has been diagnosed of high cholesterol continue to eat all kinds of fatty food in the name of spirituality? Maintaining undisciplined eating habits is foolishness. The sister who knows that she is susceptible to asthma when exposed to cold, then throws caution to the wind because she was on village evangelism, and exposes her body to cold is similarly being unwise because she could have planned to travel with a protective blanket.', '2018-02-19 12:26:35'),

(188, 52, 'The word which is translated as “servants” in verse 1 is a Greek word doulos that means either voluntary or involuntary engagement to serve. Slavery was rampant in Paul’s time (1st century A.D.), but, of course, many servants worked for their masters voluntarily. Since we are in the 21st century and slavery is not as common as it used to be, our focus shall be on voluntary servanthood or voluntary employment, which is the second meaning of the word as used by Paul in our text.', '2018-02-19 12:33:17'),
(189, 52, 'The phrase “under the yoke” (1 Tim. 6:1) signifies immediately that servants are under obligation to fulfil their responsibilities. Like a yoke ties an animal, so also does our work ties us to certain expectation and targets that must be delivered. An employer of labour is not a Father Christmas who dashes out salary every month even when employees are contributing nothing to what is coming in as income. The truth is this: either we are at home with no job and be free of any yoke, or we submit under a yoke to perform. Therefore, as a Christian employee in government or private businesses, we must have a sense of performance, <b>where we feel fulfilled each month that we have genuinely worked to earn our monthly take-home pay or bonuses.</b>', '2018-02-19 12:33:17'),
(190, 52, 'Our Christian values must come to bear in our attitude to work. Whatever is required of us as a Christian worker cannot be neglected or ignored. God expects us to be fully accountable of our duties, tasks, chores, errands, and any other assignment. Irresponsibility will not only incur the displeasure (and rebuke) of our secular boss, but our true Boss in heaven will not be pleased either. It is completely wrong when a Christian is underperforming or is a latecomer. It is a discredit to the name of the Lord when Christians are known as slothful, laid-back, and unable to meet target that is transparently set for all and sundry. How do we explain it when the students of a Christian teacher are the ones who are not passing their examinations?

(191, 52, 'The Bible’s standard for work according to our text is that we should count our masters “worthy of all honour.” This is in reference to an employer who is not a Christian, and possibly cruel and harsh towards us. We know this because of the contrast he makes with “believing masters” in the next verse. It is very common in many parts of the world, Nigeria included, for secular bosses to belittle and mistreat their workers. Paul said we should not hate them for this, but instead esteem them worthy of our respect. The primary reason for this, as explained by Paul, is “that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” This is a big responsibility for us! His point is that if an unbeliever mistreats his Christian servant or worker and the Christian responds with a negative humanistic attitude, the unbelieving boss will begin to say things like “Is this the kind of thing you Christians do?”', '2018-02-19 12:33:17'),

But yes, they are also our brethren who have been tasked as business leaders and not as a non-profit charity. We must not take our work for granted because we are Christians working with another Christian. We must always be the ones who come early, work late, go the extra mile, create new improvement ideas, and expand the opportunities because we must recognise that this is not about the employer but the fact that we are part of God’s project that our employer–Christian is privileged to pilot for the Lord.', '2018-02-19 12:33:17'),

First of all, in Colossians 4:1, Paul speaking to believing masters, said that they should give adequate salary to their employees, as they also have a Master in heaven who will reward everybody according to his works (Matt. 16:27). This foundation agrees with our previous study on good compensation for every worker. We must never exploit our Christian employees by paying them peanuts, when our profit can adequately match what other related businesses are paying. Besides salary and other statutory payment, Paul also said that masters should treat their servants well and not threaten them (Eph. 6:9), as God Himself is their Master and does not regard our status in His fair justice.

If the person is already in his 40s or 50s, he must be sincere to the fundamental reality whilst also trusting God for help through remedial efforts like adult school, home learning, and other means. If such are already married with children, there is very minimal encouragement that can make such to become a graduate banker in five years, not even at a time when companies want under-25 recruits. It becomes an issue when such persons expect their fortune to change as soon as they come into the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Paul said that if any person, even an angel from heaven, preaches any other gospel than that which they have preached, that person should be accursed (Gal. 1:8–9)! Strong words!

If God blesses him with financial abundance, he is thankful, enjoys it with moderation, and uses it to propel the cause of Lord Jesus Christ on the earth. A false teacher, on the other hand, values money and fame above everything. He loves to have a following of “disciples,” and the truth of God is of secondary importance. In his mind, godliness is only a means to get gain, which is his true aim, but covers it up with twisted applications of the Bible.

He is, therefore, looking for what more to do that will reduce his fellow competitors in a never-ending cycle of trying to prove a point. This is essentially what the rat race is. It demands that an individual works tirelessly and continually for money and material things, with little attention paid to the deeper issues of life.

We borrow our friend’s shoes to an event. We steal from the office to have an upgraded car. We send our children to schools with rates that are equal to our cumulative six months salary and get all possible loans to live in areas where our salaries cannot afford.

Just as we invest our mind, time, energy, and resources in the rat race, we also have to invest much more in the right race of God’s kingdom.', '2018-02-19 16:10:41'),
(216, 60, 'After showing us why we should be content in godliness by freedom from materialism, Paul concluded that “having food and raiment let us be therewith content” (1 Tim. 6:8). He practically simplified life’s demands down to the necessities. The crisis we face in life is essentially because we are looking for wants (every desire of our heart) rather than needs (what we need to survive now). Economics show that human wants are insatiable; therefore, we must learn to be satisfied and content even if we only have the basic necessities of life in this world. God’s Word, says that our conduct and lifestyle should be without covetousness (longing for material wealth), but we should be content with whatever God gives us (Heb. 13:5). The Lord Jesus also told us  that our heavenly Father already knows what we have need of, even before we ask Him (Matt. 6:8). On top of this, God has also promised to supply those needs according to His riches in the Lord Jesus (Phil. 4:19). So why worry or anxious about being taken care of, when our top priority must be seeking God’s kingdom and its righteousness, and the food and raiment will be added unto us, even as He feeds the birds and clothes the lilies (Matt. 6:25-33).', '2018-02-19 16:10:41'),

God’s Word lets us know that all things work together for the good of those who love God (Rom. 8:28), so any circumstances we find ourselves in is ultimately just a piece of the bigger picture. A person who is filled with the joy of the Lord does not get depressed or become hopeless even if he loses his material possessions. It takes a fullness of joy (Ps. 16:11) to remain happy and cheerful in the Lord Jesus Christ regardless of one’s circumstances. And this fullness is only found in one place: by continually abiding in His presence. This is why Paul, while he was in Roman custody as a prisoner, wrote to the Philippian church, “Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). “Always” means in any situation you find yourself: rich or poor, healthy or sick, married or alone, free or in prison, among other situations. This cannot come by riches or by the world’s standards, but only by abiding in the glorious presence of God. This kind of joy becomes our strength at all times—in season and out of season.

(220, 62, 'a)	<b>The desire.</b> Paul pointed out first a desire for money in the heart of the individual, which is the origin of the problem (1 Tim. 6:9–10). “They that will be rich”—the word translated as will is the Greek boulomai which means to will, want, or desire. The more accurate translation is, “They that desire to be rich.” In verse 10, he mentioned “The love of money”—this phrase is from the Greek philarguria which literally means love of silver [or, money]. It is also called “avarice”, which is a strong and insatiable desire for riches. The Scripture says, “He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity” (Eccl. 5:10). This is a key verse. God shows us that the love of money just leads to a desire for even more money, because there is never any true contentment or satisfaction. The verse concludes with “this is also vanity,” since it all adds up to nothing in the end. Zero plus Zero plus Zero is always Zero. Someone might say “Well, if I could only have ‘X’ amount, then I’ll be OK.” But that is what many in the past have said, and never dealt with the real problem, until they got what they wanted and raised the new expectation that, of course, will continue to be raced to no end.', '2018-02-19 16:18:47'),
(221, 62, 'b)	<b>The deception.</b> Paul mentioned that those who desire to be rich “fall into temptation and a snare” (1 Tim. 6:9). He added that “they have erred from the faith” (1 Tim. 6:10). The Greek words used in these two phrases are reminiscent of an animal that has wandered and lost his way. Then there is a pit covered with grass and sticks which the animal thought is solid ground until it eventually falls into it. This is what the desire for riches does to a person—it keeps him deluded from reality. It makes him believe he is safe and secure, walking on solid ground, until the reality dawns on him. The Lord Jesus has spoken of “the deceitfulness of riches” (Mark 4:19). <br/>\r\nVerse 9 also says that they fall into many “foolish and hurtful lusts.” This is another form of deception and trickery that an abundance of wealth can bring. Someone with limited finances cannot do too much and does not even think about certain things because he just cannot afford them. But a person that has money to spend freely is more prone to wander in his mind and begin to think about some things he ought not. He can easily afford an expensive hotel and seduce women with his riches. He can bribe his way out of any situation. He can throw extravagant parties just to flaunt and be loved by people.', '2018-02-19 16:18:47'),
(222, 62, 'c)	<b>The destruction.</b> The same way in which the wages of sin is death is the desire and love of money will end in destruction both in this world and in the world to come. In verse 9, Paul used the word “drown,” which indicates a total submerging, like someone who sinks in an ocean and has no way to swim out. They that desire to be rich fall into temptations, snares, as well as foolish and hurtful lusts, which finally submerge them into destruction. The words “destruction” and “perdition” in the original Greek both mean ruin, and it could be physical, spiritual, or eternal. <br/>\r\nWhen a man cannot control his appetite for worldly taste and is caught with the bug on seeking for money, the spirit of destruction will make such individual to go any length in a quest to satisfy the destructive desire.<br/>\r\nIn verse 10, Paul said they have “pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” The word sorrows is a Greek word that means grief or despair, which is the end result of putting confidence in money instead of God. Men who are caught in the rat race for financial possession live their days in deep pain and continued sorrows, which, unfortunately, culminate in eternal damnation.\r\n', '2018-02-19 16:18:47'),

As Christians, we are stewards of God’s property; whatever we possess ultimately belongs to the Master. God evaluates our hearts to see if we are at the point where we are strong enough to handle money without falling into the temptations that accompanies it. Christian ministry definitely requires money. The Lord Jesus, being the Owner of the silver and the gold (Hag. 2:8), had the ability to have money readily available whenever He needed it (see Matt. 17:27). We know that Paul had a business (Acts 18:3) and used the money to support his ministry (Acts 20:33–34).

This does not mean we cannot enjoy what He gives us (1 Tim. 6:17), but we must remember who the money belongs to and what it is actually for.

In other words, there are two different directions and each leads to two different destinations. The first direction is worldliness, which leads to destruction while the second direction is godliness, which leads to eternal life. Paul, in verse 11, instructed the believers to “flee these things.” What things? The things he had just mentioned to Timothy include the desire to be rich and the love of money, together with the associated foolish and hurtful lusts, which are a summary of what worldliness is (1 Tim. 6:9–10).

This instruction is a reminder to us of what the Lord Jesus has said about how the kingdom of God “suffereth violence, and the violent takes it by force” (Matt. 11:12), or in Luke 13:24 where he tells us to “strive” to enter in because many will seek to enter in but will not be able. The word he used, which is translated as “strive”, is the Greek agonizomai, which literally means “to struggle, compete, contend, or endeavour.” So we are being continually admonished to pursue the things that will lead us unto eternal life in the kingdom of God with a lot of energy, zeal, and passion.

(245, 65, 'e)	<b>Patience.</b> the word here is hupomon?, which is not just patience in the ordinary sense, but a “cheerful and hopeful endurance.” This word represents a calm delight even through trials and tribulations. It looks to God’s promises and knows that the good fight is already won. ', '2018-02-19 16:30:30'),
(246, 65, 'f)	<b>Meekness.</b> Paul uses a Greek word praot?s that means gentleness and humility. The natural man cannot submit himself to the Lordship of Christ without humility.

(247, 66, 'It has been almost 2,000 years that the faithful believers have continued fighting the good fight, at the same time taking the Gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth just as the Lord Jesus has commanded. In his short epistle, the apostle Jude (the Lord Jesus’ brother) said we should “earnestly contend for the faith . . .” (Jude 1:3). This means to strive to uphold the truth about the Lord Jesus in the face of lies, deceptions, and various forms of falsehood.

In our modern times, the Christian faith has seen many opposing belief systems try and sometimes succeed in drawing away people who once professed faith in Christ. Besides the contrary religions, we live in the era prophesied in Daniel 12:4 called ‘the time of the end’ when “knowledge shall increase.” New so-called “knowledge” of the world is coming, particularly the OSAS messages (once saved, always saved).

A Christian must always keep an eye on the end, living this present life with an eternal perspective. Paul said if our hope in Christ is for only this present life, then we are of all men most miserable (1 Cor. 15:19). So the exhortation to Timothy was to “lay hold on eternal life” (1 Tim. 6:12). We are to lay hold just as a stamp must remain stuck to a letter to ensure that both get to the destination.

(252, 68, 'In our Christian walk, we are aware of the many pressures from the devil and his demonic host, and even humans with intent to destroy our Christian profession. This was the reality of the young minister Timothy at Ephesus. The city itself was a nest of devils, and many of its citizens were against the preaching of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 19:23-28, 34). In addition to this, we see from earlier study the vileness of some false teachers who were being used by seducing spirits to propagate various doctrines of demons. Young Timothy had a sizeable amount of pressure upon him that could have easily made a person reconsider their commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ. He could have fallen into the category of the second kind of people that the Lord Jesus spoke about in the parable of the sower, who at first received the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ gladly, but later fell away after persecution and tribulation arose (Mark 4:16-17). Paul, who was full of the wisdom of God, understood the realistic nature of this danger and, therefore, wrote strong words to Timothy to keep his integrity intact irrespective of the circumstances. Sometimes we need strong words to face strong hardship and true leaders must not shy away from this. The focus of his admonition to Timothy was God Himself; he highlighted certain attributes of the Creator to remind Timothy (and us) of who the Person is that we serve and why we should never back down in light of this reality.', '2018-02-19 16:40:47'),
(253, 68, 'a)	<b>Consciousness of God’s presence. To kick off the engagement, Paul clar</b>ified the context of the discussion to be “in the sight of God” (1 Tim. 6:13). He seemed to say that everything done in heaven and on earth is clearly seen by the watchful eyes of God. He is omnipresent and omniscient, and “neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do” (Heb. 4:13). A person who is aware of God’s omnipresence and omniscience can stand confidently because he knows that he is not alone and thus we must live our Christian lives “in the sight of God”—with a full-time awareness of His presence.', '2018-02-19 16:40:47'),

Paul was essentially showing Timothy and all Christians that even if we are faced with the threat of death, God is the one who quickens all things. We have a sure promise of the resurrection and eternal life, so we can stand with integrity, when threatened, and not soften or water down our witness of the truth.', '2018-02-19 16:40:47'),

Without any sense of deep expectation of His coming, the tendency is for the Christian to become complacent and eventually crumble when faced with pressure.

This means that he has no beginning. He is uncreated Creator. It is a little easier for our finite minds to understand immortality or eternal life in the future sense, but a little more challenging to understand how God can just exist from eternity past. Some have said that God’s eternal nature, unlike a straight line, which has point A and point B, is more like a circle that has no beginning or ending.

He has the 100% right to demand for His resource anytime and for any purpose He intends it to be used for. If we wrongly assume that we own it, then we can spend it anyhow to satisfy our desire or to join the rat race of trying to be like our friends and neighbours.

The phrase “ready to distribute” is a Greek word that means the person is liberal and good at giving. This means that we must not be stingy or tight-fisted. However, this does not mean we throw money on every request that comes our way. In the same manner that a treasurer can only dip his hand and spend at the command of the treasure owner, we must be subjected to the specific instruction of the owner of the treasure on how to distribute, to whom to distribute, for what purpose, and at what time. God will never lead you to distribute into initiatives that will not promote His name or ventures that are borne out of greed or covetousness. Be advised that it is not all welfare demands that must be served if you are truly led of the Lord. The leading of the Holy Spirit is very central to the process of meeting the needs of others. In Acts 11:27–30, we see how Prophet Agabus discerned an imminent need for welfare through a prophecy on the coming famine in Jerusalem. The church readily responds to similar revelation and divine prompting.', '2018-02-19 16:47:08'),
(264, 70, 'The term “laying up in store” (1 Tim. 6:19) is similar to how we save our money in banks or our valuables in a safe today. But Paul said we should lay in store a good foundation “against the time to come.” There is a time coming. And every person will give account of himself before God, and receive the rewards for the things he has done in this present time, as many Biblical passages testify. This verse means that instead of measuring our wealth by how much we have in our bank account, we should rather store up credit with the bank of heaven. Whatever amount of money that God gives us now is to be invested wisely in the things of the kingdom. There is a process to dispense money and in TACEF, we have advised six steps on how individual finances is managed to ensure that it is justifiably distributed. The procedural rule constitutes tithe/offering, family upkeep, savings, support for parents, welfare for brethren, gifts to household of faith, and support for the poor.

They must have invested heavily in young Timothy early in life and thus provide the foundation for what he would become in the scheme of heaven.

In other words, this person actually believes the things that are written about the Lord Jesus Christ. Of course, there is no doubt that Christian parents can teach and influence us, just as Timothy’s did, but neither is there any doubt that the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ is on an individual basis through unfeigned faith.', '2018-02-19 16:54:12'),

In Genesis 18:19, we saw how God was positive that Abraham would lead his children in the way of the Lord. Our times are even tough, with many forces and ideologies that compete for our children’s minds. Our job is to use the power of the Word to protect them as God gives us wisdom. We are also instructed to “[t]rain up a child in the way that he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6).

As the Spirit made His way into our hearts, He also imparted one or more divine gifts into each believer. Paul in verse 6 of our text reminded Timothy to stir up the gift of God which he received by laying on of Paul’s hands. The words “stir up” are from the Greek word anazopureo, which actually means to rekindle. Paul told Timothy to rekindle the divine gift that was residing in him. Young Tim had already faced many challenges in ministry and as a Christian in general, which could have begun to douse the once brightly burning flame in his heart. God’s Word tells us to “[q]uench not the Spirit” (1 Thess. 5:19). The word “quench” here is the Greek sbennumi, which literally means “to extinguish,” like when a fire is put out. This means that it is possible for us to let the intensity of the Holy Spirit diminish in us, possibly through ignorance, through the daily demands of the carnal world we live in, or through “grieving” the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30) by disobedience. Whatever the case, Paul’s reminder (for Timothy and us) was to reactivate any gifts that the Spirit has deposited in us which we have allowed to fade for one reason or the other. It is a concern that many who used to operate the gift of prophecy or even word of knowledge cannot remember the last time these gifts found expression; it is like they have become “rusted” with time due to being unused or unrefined for a long period.', '2018-02-19 16:54:12'),

It is allowing ourselves to become intimidated by a person, a situation, circumstances, and so forth. Many are intimated by examination, boss at work, or even ordinary wall gecko! Fear is the opposite of faith and it comes to challenge the basis of our belief in God. Faith does not \"overcome\" fear; it actually takes it away completely. It is like Light and darkness, faith and fear cannot occupy the same space at the same time; there will be either one or the other. Faith is a choice of our will, as is fear.

He plainly says, “Ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake; but he that endures to the end shall be saved” (Matt 10:22). In other verses around this passage, He has spoken of His followers being as sheep in the midst of wolves.

Not only was Timothy to be unashamed, he was to be a partaker of the afflictions that come with professing and representing the Lord Jesus Christ. Throughout the history of the church, the Lord’s people have seen diverse kinds of persecutions, torments, and afflictions. Up till today in some parts of the world such as China, India, and many Muslim nations including Northern Nigeria, Christians are still being physically persecuted and many have to either flee or resort to “underground church.” For the rest of us, the persecution may not necessarily be physical, but more on an emotional and psychological level.

It is only God’s own power through the Holy Spirit that enables us to endure any afflictions or hardships that may come our way. No wonder the Lord Jesus called the Holy Spirit the Comforter (John 14:26).

This is what Paul was talking about (2 Tim. 1:10). The Lord Jesus came in the flesh and “abolished” death, purchasing life and immortality on behalf of His elect. Paul further said that this Good News has been committed to him to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher (2 Tim. 1:11).

The Lord Jesus has said, “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work” (John 4:34). The Lord Jesus was willing to work for and glorify God the Father on earth, even if the work included dying on a Roman cross. Paul was willing to work for and glorify the Lord on earth, even if it included dying at the hands of a Roman emperor. We also should be willing to work for God and glorify Him on earth (1 Cor. 10:31), even if it means persecution and death.

It is not sufficient to be excited at the aura of the church and the faith-boosting miraculous without coming to one’s own conclusions about God. This comes only by revelation. Job reached that moment and could emphatically say, “I know that my redeemer liveth” (Job 19:25), in the midst of all his anguish and pain. The word he used there is the Hebrew yâda which means “to know or ascertain by seeing.” This was before God spoke audibly to him (Job 38:1). Job had never seen a vision of God literally before this (Job 42:5), but he had seen God by revelation and was fully convinced of his standpoint with Him. Wow!', '2018-02-19 17:04:49'),

That word “kept” in the original language means guard or protect, similar to what Paul said. It means that God preserves and keeps us in the Lord Jesus Christ, as we live our lives through this world unto the end of the journey. He will not let us go or fall by the wayside, because He has chosen us for Himself. The Lord Jesus says that He has given us eternal life, that we will never perish, and that nobody can pluck us out of His hand (John 10:28). Paul had full expectation of God keeping His promise.

Its chief city was Ephesus, leading other notable cities of the “seven churches” including Philadelphia, Laodicea, Smyrna, Sardis, Thyatira, and Pergamum. The church of the Colossians was also right next door. After all that Paul had done for these people, it must have been quite painful for him to say, “all they which are in Asia be turned away from me.” Remember that Paul had, by the grace of God, ministered to all people from all walks of life, including people in authority and positions of power, who could have used their position with the Roman government to come to his assistance, especially because he was also a Roman, who should naturally enjoy certain privileges as a man with dual citizenship. They were in a position to help, but drew back either out of embarrassment or fear, not wanting to be openly known as associates of Paul, the outlaw. No wonder Paul appealed to Timothy not to be ashamed of his bonds (2 Tim. 1:8), and applauded Onesiphorus for not being ashamed of his chains (2 Tim. 1:16). Many of his supposed brethren had abandoned him, especially those who could have made a difference, fearing the “afflictions of the Gospel.” This reminds of many notable Jews who believed in the Lord Jesus, but only secretly with no open association because they were more concerned with maintaining their reputation (Luke 23:50–52, John 3:1–2, 12:42, 19:38).', '2018-02-19 17:12:54'),

Who knows what he had to go through in order to visit and minister to the ageing apostle in his Roman cell (or dungeon). He first of all had to diligently seek Paul out (1 Tim. 1:17). There also had to be an official procedure and questioning which a person had to go through before being allowed to visit prisoners, especially an internationally known figure like Paul. He must have been so guarded like Nelson Mandela was in a place where no one could easily access, not even journalists or government officials. This man took the pain and a huge risk to be identified with a notorious ringleader of the Christian sect (Acts 24:5), especially seeing that Nero was in power at that time. Nero was a most brutal enemy of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and remained the biggest antagonist for his hatred and persecution of Christians. But Onesipherous’ love and genuine concern for Paul outweighed any opposing threats that stood in his way. From the moment he found Paul, and saw his deplorable condition, he did not minister to him just once, but he kept coming back “oft.” This word, “oft” is the Greek pollakis which means “many times” or “frequently.” He knew that Paul needed refreshing. The word “refreshed” is the Greek anapsucho which means “relieve.” – when someone’s presence re-energises, renews, and reignites someone’s passion, there can never be a better person to have around. We also do know that there are certain people who come around only to throw pity party, blame game, and make you feel bad and worse off. Imagine there could have been some other brethren who come around to tell Paul that he was not smart or diplomatic enough.

Note that this was Paul’s second time in Roman custody, not under Claudius Caesar like before, but now under Nero—the demonic god-king.

Of course, the answer to this prayer is sure, according to the words of the Lord Jesus Himself.

We also understand that we do not only get a reward now in this life, but even in the world to come. If we check again verse 18 of our text, Paul’s second prayer for mercy was that the Lord should grant it unto him “in that day.” The Bible shows us that even among the Christians who are saved, we shall still stand before the judgement seat of the Lord Christ and each person will be rewarded according to what deeds he has done in this present time (see Luke 19:16–19, Rom. 14:10–12, 1 Cor. 3:12-15, 2 Cor. 5:10).

This immediately tells us, like many other New Testament passages also affirm that we are not saved by our good deeds. Rather, we are saved by the grace of God, through faith, that is, the grace of God gives us the faith needed to accept the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. That is why He said it is the gift of God. The word “gift” is the Greek doron which literally means “a present.” Salvation is a gift or present from God, which God in His own sovereign freewill chose to give to His people. After Paul had preached the Gospel to the people of Antioch Pisidia, God’s Word says, “as many as were ordained to eternal life believed” (Acts 13:48). Not everybody believed, only those who were ordained to eternal life. The word “ordained” is the Greek tasso which means “to assign to a certain position or lot.” In other words, it was pure grace to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ unto life eternal.

In other words, we are saved by God’s grace and not by works, but that same grace of God empowers us to do good works, which is one reason He “created” us in the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus, in the first place. Therefore, obeying His commandments is necessary, but our obedience flows from His grace and not from carnal effort. Just as Paul said that he was who he was by the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10).

Do not be carried away when these teachers quote so many Scriptures with many Greek analogies that are contrary to the simplicity of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the same issue that Jude was talking about in his short epistle, when he raised a red flag that many were “turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness”; they thought they could use the Good News of the Lord Jesus Christ’s grace as a reason to live sinful lives, but in the process they were really “denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ” (Jude 1:4). Paul showed us that justification through the Lord Jesus Christ does not make us free to sin, since the Lord Jesus Christ is not the minister of sin (Gal. 2:17). Paul showed us how he himself was “crucified” with the Lord Jesus Christ, who was the one who lived in him and through him (Gal. 2:20). Paul topped it up by saying, “I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain” (Gal. 2:21). So he was not saved by works; nevertheless, he himself (the old man) was crucified, and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Righteous One lived through him. This is what Grace does for the believer and not a license to live with a mind-set that every yesterday, today, and tomorrow’s sins have been forgiven and thus can live anyhow.

His service to God was one that brought all kinds of tribulation and challenges for him, as shown in a summary of his suffering (2 Cor. 11:23–29). As if this was not enough, God allowed him to live with a “thorn in the flesh” (2 Cor. 12:7). Many have speculated about what this “thorn in the flesh” was. Maybe it was a kind of physical ailment, or it could have been something else entirely. Whatever it was, he asked the Lord on three different occasions to relieve him of this problem (2 Cor. 12:8). God’s profound reply was, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9). Paul understood this statement and, therefore, concluded by saying, “when I am weak, then am I strong” (2 Cor. 12:10). It is reminiscent of the Scripture that says, “let the weak say, I am strong” (Joel 3:10).', '2018-02-19 17:21:22'),
(306, 85, 'God’s grace is always ever sufficient for us. None of us has ever gone through anything close to what Paul had to endure. Human being can only take so much pain to a degree. But God’s grace gives us sufficient strength to go through anything. At the beginning of that same epistle (2 Cor 1:8-9), Paul said that they were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that they despaired even of life. “Above strength” means they did not even have the energy to handle the pressure anymore: so they “despaired even of life,” that is, they were ready to quit and die. But they did not quit for one single reason: they stopped trusting in themselves and looked to God who is the raiser of the dead (2 Cor. 1:9). This is the meaning of “my grace is sufficient for you” and “my strength is made perfect in weakness.” This is exactly what Timothy needed for his own tribulations, as Paul could speak from experience when he said, “My son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 2:1).

(307, 85, 'In our Christian journey of reasonable service, we might be faced with many challenges and obstacles, and sometimes not even know what else to do to move forward. But if we stop looking to our own strength and begin to look up to God for His grace, then we will see that truly His grace is indeed more than enough to get us through. His strength is perfected in our weakness, so we ourselves cannot take the glory or credit, but must confess that if not for the Lord, we never would have made it just like the popular song says.', '2018-02-19 17:21:22'),
(308, 86, 'Now that we have received God’s Word, a responsibility has been placed on us to communicate that same truth to others also. The word “commit” in our text is the Greek paratithemi which means ‘to deposit something as a trust or for protection’. It means you place the thing (God’s Word) into the hands (or heart) of another person with expectation of the receiver doing the right thing with it. This should be the basic benchmark of what discipleship should be. It is, of course, not just inviting people to a church or fellowship to count as statistics but to labour in ways that can deposit all the investments of the Lord Jesus Christ in someone’s life, that is, investment of the word, spirit, discipline, fruits of the Spirit, good works, eternity, heavenly consciousness, and so forth.', '2018-02-19 17:26:31'),
(309, 86, 'The discipleship and the continued passing of the Gospel truth is similar to a relay race, where one runner hands the baton to another, who, in turn, hands it to another, until the race is finally completed. Paul was in a Roman cell facing execution (2 Tim. 4:6–7) and was handing the baton to Timothy, who was mandated to hand it to others. The faithfulness of such men down the historical timeline is the reason we are here today with God’s Word readily available for our use and benefit. However, we have not been given the baton to hold and keep to ourselves, but must pass it down to our fellow men and women. We must also pass it in the same manner as it was given to us. We cannot reduce the size of the baton to make the process of exchange faster. We cannot watch the baton reduce to the size of an ordinary pin because we are now in the technology “instant noodle” generation of unbaked Christians, who are products of spiritual kwashiorkor (overeaten of Christian messages that are based on a single truth, such as material prosperity, hypergrace or demonology). We cannot reduce the essence of the baton because it is now an “old baton” that does not look like our desired modernity. We are called to handle the baton in the size and shape as it was handed down to us—we are not to compromise the standard of God or blend it to serve the worldly pressures of our time. We must consciously entrust the Gospel message and doctrine to others: leaders must transfer to people they disciple, excos to next generation of excos, husbands to their wives and children, and every Christian in general to whomever God connects us with. This is how we preserve the legacy of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.', '2018-02-19 17:26:31'),

(311, 87, 'The demand for effective baton exchange was also specific. The mandate has to be given to people who met certain criteria. It is not an all-comers affair. The word “able” as used by Paul in our text is the Greek hikanos which means “COMPETENT.” An effective baton handler, whose aim is to make people disciples for the Lord Jesus Christ, must be competent. He must be adequate for the purpose, well equipped, sufficiently qualified, capable, and efficient. We can only give what we have in abundance. Men who are great baton exchangers are well trained to exchange batons under any circumstances—whether it is 100m or 400m race—they are well groomed, hence they can pass the baton well.', '2018-02-19 17:26:31'),
(312, 87, 'This is one of the reasons Paul told Timothy, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). To be genuinely competent, able, and qualified to impart and commit Biblical truth to others, we have to be  “faithful” men and women. We must be well grounded and with solid foundation. We must also prepare for every opportunity and platform that God provides to pass on the baton. For us, every opportunity to preach, teach, share Bible study outline, facilitate a seminar, coordinate a programme, plan an outreach, lead a prayer, share announcements, and so forth is another opportunity to pass the baton of excellence, where someone can look up to that simple task and be inspired to raise the game in their little corner because a path of excellence has been deposited, albeit unconsciously. TACEF is praying for high-quality brothers and sisters, who are so well prepared for every opportunity given to them to provoke godly revival, hunger for God, and an accompanying passion for excellence by reasons of how the assignment has been done for the Lord. We are tired of men who weaken standards and use divine platforms unprepared and with no sense of “What will I use this short moment to deposit in my hearers and observers?”', '2018-02-19 17:26:31'),
(313, 87, 'This competence dimension must also be completed with faithfulness as advocated by Paul. This twin dimension makes reasonable service last a lifetime of impact. The word “faithful” is the Greek pistos which means “trustworthy.” It means that the person is loyal, reliable, dependable, and can be counted on. Someone whom you know will faithfully adhere to the standards required of the platform and will not weaken the opportunity by virtue of unpreparedness or lack of divine inspiration.

(314, 88, 'The phrase “endure hardship” is a Greek word kakopatheo which means to “undergo hardship.” It means that we withstand difficult situations and challenges while looking towards the positive outcome of our determination. The main point that describes a good soldier is that he does not entangle himself with the affairs of this life. The word “entangle” is the Greek empleko which means to “entwine or get involved with.” A soldier at war has no choice but to remain focused on the mission and the reality of his extreme life-or-death conditions. Even when the soldiers are not presently engaged in battle with the enemy but camping out, there is still no time to waste with matters that do not concern the war. He cannot, for example, consider looking for a woman and starting a family. That would only be a major distraction that could end up costing lives. His only concern is the present war and the best strategies for winning battles.', '2018-02-19 17:32:48'),
(315, 88, 'For a Christian, the “affairs of this life” which Paul stated can be compared with the “cares of this world” which the Lord Jesus mentioned (Mark 4:19). In that parable of the sower, the person who received seed among thorns “entangled” himself with those affairs of life, which choked him and rendered him ineffective and unfruitful. We as Christians living in this world cannot afford to get ourselves mixed up in all the things the unsaved are involved in. Most television shows are just distractions and waste of precious time. Many festivals and ceremonies are just unnecessary and may not even concern us, so we do not have to attend all of them. Many associations we try to belong to or activities we do for relevance only waste our precious times and reduce the time we have to focus on what is important. Can you imagine a father who spend all his weekend attending to events and activities, and cannot spare one hour to check his children’s book. What a parent living in delusion of entanglement that is out of purpose! We must remember that we are engaged in warfare against Satan and his demonic host. We cannot afford the entanglements of the ungodly world, but should keep our lives as simple as possible, similar to the good soldier at war whose aim is to please Him who has chosen him to be a soldier. God’s Word warns us against loving this world and getting entwined with the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:15–17). A good soldier at war will do the will of his commander, and “he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever” (1 John 2:17). Not only do we win the battles of life if we remain focused, but we also have the eternal reward promised to those who obey the Commander-in-Chief, Jesus Christ, our Lord.', '2018-02-19 17:32:48'),
(316, 89, 'The next analogy is the athlete. The term “strive for masteries” (2 Tim. 2:5) is the Greek athle? which literally means to “contend in the competitive games.” It is from this Greek word we derive our English words ‘athletics’ and ‘athlete’. But the verse says that if a man contends in the competitive games, it is not possible for him to receive the crown of victory unless he competes lawfully. The word “lawfully” is the Greek nomimos which means “according to the rules.” So the athlete must do two major things if he desires to obtain the crown: (a) He must prepare his body and contend, and (b) He must compete according to the rules.', '2018-02-19 17:32:48'),

To be a reasonable competitor who stands a chance of winning, he cannot prepare by doing a little jogging every other day in his neighbourhood. He must instead discipline his body properly through rigorous exercises that will get his muscles fit for endurance, along with abstinence from foods and drinks that are too fatty or sugary. For us as Christians, this means that we must exercise spiritual discipline through activities like diligent Bible study, prayer, and deep meditation. We must also fast like the athlete by abstaining not only from too much food, but also from sin and ungodliness. We cannot clog our spiritual system with weights that reduce our ability to run the race with grace.', '2018-02-19 17:32:48'),
(318, 89, 'In addition, the athlete cannot be crowned unless he strives lawfully, that is, according to the established rules. Disobeying the rules in any sporting competition gets us penalised, in accordance to the degree of the violation. We also as Christians must compete according to the rules of God’s Word, as disobeying God’s Word means we are penalised and cut off  from receiving God’s blessing (see Col. 3:25, Deut. 28:15). For example, we cannot be dishonest in business dealings and expect God to bless our business. We cannot cheat on our spouse and expect our marriage to be blessed. We cannot come to minister unprepared and expect God to be happy with us. We cannot spend our tithe and expect the windows of heaven to open for us. We cannot be lazy at work and expect God to grant our request for promotions—see what happens to those who have been diligent, even though they are unbelievers. God is not partial and He does not reward slothful behaviours. We cannot seek for long life and fail in basic hygienic and healthy living. We cannot treat our parents anyhow and expect our own children to treat us like a king or queen; there are rules to every game (parenting, business, ministry, service, employment, discipleship etc.).

(321, 90, 'Verse 6 of our text speaks of the “husbandman.” This is an Old English word derived from the Greek georgos, which means a farmer. First of all, Paul said that the farmer must labour. The word “labour” here is the Greek kopiao which does not just mean to work, but to “work hard and feel fatigue.” It means that the farmer works to the point of physical exhaustion. He works himself, in season and out of season until breaking point. During this time, there was no farming machinery as we have today, hence the farmer had to labour to get the ground tilled, prepare the land, sow his seeds, manage the weeds, ensure consistent watering, and so forth. After this, a different kind of work comes next—which is the work of exercising great patience while the crops grow. God’s Word exhorts us to be patient in our waiting on the Lord’s return (James 5:7). He compared our needed patience to that of the farmer who has no choice but to wait for the early and latter rain, before the precious fruit finally comes. So the Christian has to not only sow good seeds through practical righteousness, since a man reaps whatever he sows (Gal. 6:7), but he must also learn to be patient in receiving the fruit of his labour now in this time, and finally, when the Lord returns. Similarly, a farmer gets surprises with unfortunate events such as farm fire, pest infection, and farm destruction by animals; a Christian who suffers unfavourable, unexpected events in this world for doing what is right must still continue to sow his good seeds and not get discouraged (1 Pet. 2:19-20). God’s Word says, “Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not” (Gal. 6:9). Patience through the waiting period when our seed appears buried in the soil is very critical because we know that the seed is not buried but planted and at the right time, it will yield its fruit.', '2018-02-19 17:32:48'),
(322, 91, 'One of our greatest sources of encouragement is the suffering and ultimate victory of the Lord Jesus Himself. Paul told us to remember that the Lord Jesus Christ was human, a literal descendant of David. The other apostles, such as Peter and John, walked with Him when he was on the earth, so they knew this very well. But Paul and Timothy (and we also) never saw the Lord Jesus suffer and die. So Paul was reminding Timothy and all other Christians that the Lord Jesus was indeed a flesh-and-blood human being who physically suffered and was crucified on a cross. But He triumphed over death and the grave by His physical resurrection from the dead. The Lord Jesus Himself foretold His disciples about His coming ordeal and final victory. God’s Word tells us to consider that the Lord Jesus was sinless yet He endured suffering at the hands of sinners and we, therefore, should not get tired physically or mentally through our own trials which may sometimes seem unfair (Heb. 12:3). In addition, we also have the promise from God of the resurrection and glorification of our own bodies, the Lord Jesus Himself being the model or prototype and first begotten from the dead (Col. 1:18, Rev. 1:5).', '2018-02-19 17:42:20'),

But the bigger point is that the Gospel personally saved him, who was once the “chief of sinners” (1 Tim 1:15–16). If we as Christians want to successfully endure through the hardships and get to the end of the marathon, we must be like Paul and get to a point where the reality is so personal that we consider the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as “our Gospel.” This degree of making it very personal draws for us strength even when we seem lonely in our journey.', '2018-02-19 17:42:20'),

The word “evildoer” is a Greek word kakourgos which means a wrongdoer, but more specifically, a “criminal.” Paul was suffering trouble and enduring hardship as a common criminal would, even being bound with chains. Our Christian lives will sometimes bring trouble, which may not be any fault of ours.

If the Lord Jesus means all to you, then you must take pride in that relationship and be willing to live without being ashamed.

Can you imagine when someone builds a revelation around Moses removing his shoes by Mount Sinai as basis for people not to wear their shoes, or someone arguing that tithe was only mentioned in the Old Testament and thus not applicable in the New Testament, or a prophet who curses on slightest provocation on an excuse that Elisha cursed some little kids? These three types of errors require a proper “division” of the Word of God.

It is not studying by face value but being diligent at mastery of the Word of God with good understanding of application and relevance.

Verse 19 of our text says that regardless of what anybody teaches or believes, the foundation of God remains steadfast. A “seal” is the Greek word sphragis which means “an official stamp.” This seal or official stamp was used in Paul’s time to verify the authenticity of the origin of a letter sent from an important individual, like a king or governor. Many impostors wrote letters using the names of important and well-known individuals, and many fake “Gospels” and “epistles” were written by fraudsters who used some of the apostles’ names, with the intent of spreading false teaching as apostolic truth. But a seal, especially from a king or governor, was imitation-proof and a letter sealed with such a stamp ensured the recipient that this document actually came from the said authority.', '2018-02-19 20:13:38'),
(343, 96, 'God also uses seals, as seen in Rev 5:1. And verse 19 of our text mentions two identifying marks of the seal of God’s sure foundation: (a) “The Lord knoweth them that are his”: This is the ultimate seal that separates His own from the impostors. This is because salvation originates from God Himself, and He knows the fake from original (b) “Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity”: People who belong to the Lord are proven and confirmed by their lifestyle, which is to depart from iniquity. People who live in iniquity are a fraud. They have no logo or image or the seal of the Lord and are therefore counterfeits.', '2018-02-19 20:13:38'),
(344, 97, 'Paul, in verse 20, used a simple depiction to portray two different situations in which two people can come into agreement with. The first observation from the text is that there is “a great house.” The vessels of silver and gold in such a house are used for honourable purposes such as a banquet with important guests. The wooden and earthen vessels are far less honourable and may be used for keeping less important things and for less important occasions—plus they are easily broken and easily replaced.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),

In the kitchen, however, a completely opposite vessel stores the trash. It is of value, but in a different manner. In the same vein, a cup can be used at a dinner and a variant of it can be used in a toilet—same cup but different purposes. One unto honour and the other unto dishonour.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(346, 97, 'The great house represents the kingdom of God while the vessels describe the different types of people in God\'s kingdom.

The word dishonour can be translated as ignoble, a word that simply means inferior, base, or of low character. So, one example describes a person of maturity, the other describes a person of less development. It is clear enough to say that each of us have a role to play in what we become in the great house. The degree to which we commit ourselves to the path of reasonable service will determine how far the law of greatness will find expression in our lives and this will determine the level of honour or dishonour that our lives will enjoy. Hence, Paul’s position that we just “purge” ourselves because the Master only uses honourable vessels.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),

If we want to be vessels unto honour, we must purge ourselves from iniquity, which those who name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ must depart from.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(349, 98, 'If we purge ourselves, we will be “sanctified,” That is a Greek word hagiazo which means to be purified, and it is twofold. First, we are sanctified by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:30, Heb. 10:10). However, we need practical and continuous sanctification by cooperating with the Holy Spirit to work in us the process of purification, as we crucify the flesh (1 Thess. 4:3–7, 1 Pet. 1:2). This is the only way for a Christian to be a vessel meet for the Master’s use. A dirty spoon or plate previously used by someone else will be unacceptable, unless it is first washed and cleansed. Or how many of us will not make effort to cleanse ourselves every morning, even when we have had a most thorough bath the previous night? So is it also with God. He will not use us if we do not continually cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit (2 Cor. 7:1). Our reasonable service totally depends on this because God has already done His part by sending His Son Jesus, and putting His Spirit within us. It is now our responsibility to purge ourselves if we want to be greatly used by the Lord.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(350, 99, 'The major way in which we cooperate with the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification involves two dimensions: We must consciously flee from sin and we must also pursue godliness. Fleeing from them is the first step to our preparation for the Master’s use.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(351, 99, 'The “lusts” which we are told to flee from is the Greek epithumia which can be a general desire or longing, but more specifically for something forbidden. They also pertain more to the younger adults than the elderly. This lust includes all forms of immoralities such as pornography, flirting on social media, and masturbation, among others.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(352, 99, 'In addition, we must actively follow righteousness, faith, charity, and peace, which can be grouped together under the umbrella of godliness. The word “follow” is the Greek diõkõ which means to pursue something or someone. It means going after something vigorously, and is the same word used (to mean, “persecute”) in many places in the New Testament. This, therefore, underscores the fervency, energy, and passion with which we must run after the things of God. Following godliness cannot be passive, but requires our zealous pursuit of God’s will with a determination to obey. The Lord Jesus has said, “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled” (Matt. 5:6). We must be hungry and thirsty for righteousness to be filled with it. We must be determined to press on towards the ultimate in godliness.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),
(353, 99, 'Also, Paul said we are to pursue godliness “with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.” This means we are to pursue this endeavour with other Christians who are already moving in that direction, whose hearts and motives are pure before God. This speaks of the right kind of people whose lives can provoke us on the journey, as we are to provoke one another unto love and to good works (Heb. 10:24). Proverbs 27:17 also tells us that iron sharpens iron, so those who are seeking the same pursuit of godliness will naturally encourage and strengthen one another. It will be a disaster when we surround ourselves with people who do not have the same spiritual pursuit as ours. It is a misadventure if our best friend today is not our prayer partner or spiritual catalyst. When a firebrand Christian has unbelievers or cold Christians as best friends, he must be sure that their influence will one day weaken his pursuit of God. They will complain that we are becoming too “churchy” and of course, the weight of the temptation can push some back. Let us be careful of who we associate with because they determine how far we can go in God.', '2018-02-19 20:22:04'),

A vessel that is already clean is presently meet for the use of the owner because it has undergone the process of being washed and cleansed. If we are still harbouring sin, it will be difficult to be used by the Lord to minister to others.

(355, 100, 'Some issues concerning doctrine and theology are not worth getting involved in, if the other person is just determined to argue and debate. Paul said we should avoid “foolish and unlearned questions” (2 Tim. 2:23). The phrase in the original language is “stupid and ignorant disputes.” It represents a situation where the person is ill-informed and negatively poised about the topic, similar to those who desire “to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm” (1 Tim. 1:7). Paul said we should avoid these kinds of people since they already believe they are right and are willing to get into heated debates to prove their position. Can you imagine spending three days arguing with a man who believes there is no hell when that time could have been used to pray for the same person for divine revelation? When we spend so much effort on proving our points, as if God cannot on His own accord open their eyes, we mistakenly engender strifes. “Engender” here is the Greek gennao which means to procreate or beget, like a parent giving birth to a child. So foolish and unlearned questions will most likely give birth to “strifes” [mache = battle or controversy]. The next verse tells us that the servant of the Lord must not strive. A man of God must never be caught in the provocation that hot debate can trigger.

This is why subsequent verses use words like “apt to teach” and “instructing.” It says we should teach and instruct “those that oppose themselves.” What kinds of people are those? The phrase in the original Greek means people who debate with their own selves; probably from listening to many different doctrines and cannot come to a certain conclusion about what is actually true. They end up favouring a particular doctrine above the others but remain deluded, spiritually and mentally being held captive in Satan’s snare.

The sense of urgency of this Word can be understood better in its military application as \"apt for war\" (2 Kings 24:16). A man or woman who wants to stay long in the act of reasonable service must be well preloaded with appropriate Scripture for every situation.

(360, 101, 'a)	<b>Non-quarrelsome.</b> The first thing we are to remember is that the servant of the Lord must not strive (2 Tim. 2:24). The word “strive” is the Greek machomai which means to war or “quarrel.” It means we must not have a mind that is over-determined to prove its point even if it leads into physical exchange of blows. This is not the method of the Spirit in our endeavour to correct the confused person. Paul continually warned Timothy in both epistles to avoid quarrels and debates because he knew they would not help anybody. In fact in, he said striving about words is not only unprofitable but also subverts the hearers (2 Tim. 2:14), leaving them in a worse state than they previously were. ', '2018-02-19 20:33:38'),
(361, 101, 'b)	<b>Gentle.</b> Paul then said that the servant of the Lord must be “gentle” unto all men. This is a Greek word epios which means “mild” or “kind.” It means that God’s servant is not harsh in his treatment of others, especially those who need guidance into God’s truth. If we are not gentle when we minister to others, how do they believe the genuine simplicity of the Lord Jesus? We must remember we are trying to help another human being, not a show off of knowledge or status.', '2018-02-19 20:33:38'),
(362, 101, 'c)	<b>Patient.</b> this is a Greek word anexikakos that means “enduring of ill” or “forbearing.” When a servant of the Lord is in the process of correcting another person, he may begin to get annoyed or find fault. We must take it patiently, forbearing and enduring the unfriendliness, as long as we still see there is hope to win the person and they have not rejected us or our assistance with clear hostility. We must be patient for as long as necessary, because our desire is to see the person freed from the deception of the devil and embrace the truth of God.', '2018-02-19 20:33:38'),
(363, 102, 'After we have played our part and done everything we are meant to do, Paul said that “if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth” (2 Tim. 2:25). This tells us that God is the One who has the final say as to whether a person’s eyes will be opened to see and accept His truth or not. The word “peradventure” in the original language is mepote which means “perhaps,” indicating that the event may take place or it may not. “Give” is didomi and literally means “give.” So God may give repentance and acceptance of truth, or He may withhold it for reasons He knows best. It is sad to assume the role of the assistant Holy Spirit who can change a person and thus dissipate so much energy in the flesh as a way to correct or lead someone to the way of the Lord.', '2018-02-19 20:33:38'),
(364, 102, 'God is the only One who grants repentance, which will thereby help the individuals to “recover themselves” out of Satan’s snare. To recover self in the original Greek is the word ananepho and it means to “regain one’s senses.” The devil’s “snare” is a Greek word pagis which means a trap, a trick or a strategy. All these opine that Satan previously had the person’s senses in captivity through his tricks and deceptive strategies. No wonder the Lord Jesus said “ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32). It is acknowledging the truth that sets a person free from the mental captivity of Satan, who is the father of lies (John 8:44).', '2018-02-19 20:33:38'),

The Lord Jesus speaking about the end-times has said, “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold” (Matt. 24:12). The origin of the problem which we see in verses 2–4 of our text is misdirected love. The beginning of the list says that men shall be “lovers of their own selves,” and the end of the list says that they shall be “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.” Their love will become misdirected, inverted, or turned upside down. They are lovers of their own selves but do not love their neighbour, and lovers of pleasures but do not love God—a subverting of the two greatest commandments. All the other vices flow from this, including the second one listed as “covetous,” which is the Greek philarguros that means “lover of money.” Love of self and love of pleasures inevitably leads to love of money, because it can buy all the pleasures that the self desires—and is the root of all kinds of evil (1 Tim. 6:10), as our list shows.

However, the Lord Jesus hinted that in the end-times the people of the world will be “as the days of Noah” (Matt. 24:37–39). He was primarily talking about the nonchalant attitude of “eating and drinking,” but the other things he said previously in that chapter tells us that the wickedness of man will also be similar to how it was in Noah’s day before the flood.', '2018-02-19 20:41:56'),

Most times, as Satan did with Eve, they target women because they are the weaker vessel (1 Pet. 3:7), and are usually more vulnerable than men. Generally, women follow their feelings, while men follow facts. But there is a warning here for all of us, male or female. These men are false teachers who continually seek wisdom but never come to the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ or Biblical reality (2 Tim. 3:7).

God’s genuine people must turn away from these cults. Their messages are often appealing and arouse spiritual curiosity, which many people naïvely fall prey to. Be careful each time a so-called pastor is stepping out of the Bible boundaries in their type of unbiblical prayers, use of prayer objects (e.g., egg, soap, powder), use of names other than the name of the Lord Jesus, and unnecessary closeness and engagement of one’s body during their so-called deliverance sessions.', '2018-02-19 20:41:56'),

Their names are not mentioned in the book of Exodus or anywhere else in the Bible, but Paul could have gotten the information from some ancient Jewish writings which Timothy was also familiar with. Do not be deceived to accept someone as a man of God because people are falling under the anointing or because miracles are happening. Magicians are different from God-ordained miracle workers. These men, such as the magicians, imitated God’s miracles which He did through Moses, but only succeeded in doing so for a short while. All power ultimately comes from God.', '2018-02-19 20:41:56'),

May our lives be a magnet that attracts men to the Lord Jesus Christ and not repel them away, in the Lord Jesus’ name. Amen.', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(385, 108, 'Paul was a genuine Christian, as Timothy testified, who endured much persecution. He also mentioned in verse 12 that “All who will live godly in the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” Persecution comes in different degrees that can range from mocking and rejection to physical violence and death. The worst kind of persecution most of us will face these days is more emotional than physical, and can happen in our workplace, school, neighbourhood, and everywhere else. But many Christians today have to escape death frequently, especially in Muslim countries (including Northern Nigeria) and communist nations like China. Those who are still alive today can say with Paul, “Out of them all the Lord delivered me” (2 Tim. 3:11).', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(386, 108, 'Persecution is part of the package whichever form it comes; therefore, we must pray for one another, that the Lord keep us courageous in any situation we find ourselves. We must never deny our faith, but remain genuine followers of the Lord Jesus Christ till the very end.', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(387, 108, 'On the opposite end of the spectrum from those who live godly in Christ are those “Christians” who only have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. Paul called them evil men and seducers (2 Tim. 3:13). The word “seducers” is the Greek go?s, which means an “impostor,” someone who makes deceitful pretences. He is essentially an actor showing himself to be someone he is really not. We have explained this in our last study like all the actors we see on stage who may act the role of a pastor today and the same actor can act the role of a herbalist in another movie tomorrow. He only becomes a versatile actor by the ability to act different roles – from a madman to a rich man in different movies. Each movie or situation demands different characters that are changing depending on the script. These kinds of “changing actors” in spiritual lifestyle will grow worse in their deception of others and in their own delusions. Stop being an actor in your spiritual journey who acts spiritual when on campus and acts carnal when far away from the brethren!', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(388, 109, 'In verses 14–15 of our text, we find out certain things which Timothy learnt and different sources from which he learnt them. “Knowing of whom thou hast learned them” signifies that we should be sure of where we are learning our Biblical revelations. We cannot buy a new car from a second-hand market and expect it will not knock sooner than expected. Know your source and be sure of its quality!', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(389, 109, 'Verse 15 reveals the other source of Timothy’s education: “From a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.” Timothy might have studied the Scriptures on his own, but more likely was guided from an early age by his mother and grandmother (2 Tim. 1:5). Learning from God through His Word and through his people (Paul, Lois, Eunice) is the foundation upon which Paul said Timothy was “assured” of the things which he learnt. This is what Christians should do today also. Our primary source is the Bible, and our secondary source is genuine men and women of God who have many years of reasonable service under their belt.', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(390, 109, 'Paul said that Timothy should “continue” in the things which he learned. That word “continue” is the Greek meno and it means to stay, abide, or remain. It carries a sense of someone or something being consistent. It is the same word that the Lord Jesus used repeatedly in John 15:4, when He was emphasising our need to abide in Him. As we abide, growth comes because the abiding branches of the vine in John 15:4 will grow and then bear fruit, as they remain connected to their source. Spiritual growth and maturity must be our aim.', '2018-02-19 21:00:01'),
(391, 110, 'First, we need to understand what Paul meant when he said “Scripture,” which is the original Greek word graph? and it means “holy writing.” Sometimes it refers to the entire Old Testament (e.g., Luke 24:45, John 10:35). It may also refer to a passage or portion of the Old Testament (Luke 4:21). But it equally refers to the New Testament (1 Tim. 5:18) where Paul quoted Luke 10:7 as a Scripture. And Peter acknowledged Paul’s writings as a Scripture (2 Pet. 3:16). ', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(392, 110, 'Throughout history, many wrote documents and claimed they came from God, but the Holy Spirit has separated the counterfeit for us and faithfully preserved His Word. The 39 books of the Old Testament have been the Jewish canon since the centuries before Christ, and the Lord Jesus also used the same Old Testament, which we have today. The New Testament was written by the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, and again, the Holy Spirit has thankfully separated the counterfeit writings of false apostles from the authentic 27 “books.” We have 66 books altogether in the Bible.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(393, 110, 'The phrase “given by inspiration of God” is two Greek words combined together: Theos, which is God, and pneo, which means “breathe out.” The two words as used together is Theopneustos and literally means “breathed out by God.” Paul was telling Timothy and all Christians that the Word of God carries the breath of God. Even though the words of Scripture were penned by human hands, they were under the total control and influence of breath or spirit of God. Peter said that “holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20–21). Beloved, we can be confident that the Bible is not the words of men, but God through His Spirit is the true Author. If the Creator of the earth and the heavens is a God of truth, then we can trust Him. “The Scriptures are as reliable as God is,” a man of God once said.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(394, 111, 'After affirming the divine origin of Scripture, Paul then gave us four benefits of applying the Bible to our lives:', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(395, 111, 'a)	<b>For doctrine.</b> God’s Words are profitable for doctrine (or teaching). Sound doctrine comes from God, while false doctrine comes from seducing spirits and devils. God is the Source of truth (Ps. 119:160), while the devil is the father of lies (John 8:44). We need doctrinal truths to answer the many questions concerning human existence. Who is the Creator? What is our purpose on this planet? Why so much pain and suffering? What lies after death? Who determines what is right and what is wrong? Many other questions are answered in the Bible through God’s eternal wisdom, including those which have to do with our practical daily lives: How should I treat other people? How should I relate concerning money? How should we raise children? How should we relate with unbelievers? To simplify it, <b>the Bible is the manufacturer’s manual for proper operation of the created product.</b> The doctrines and teachings found therein are for our good; and we will be wise to apply them to our daily lives.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(396, 111, 'b)	<b>For reproof.</b> The word here is the Greek elegchos which means “conviction.” The Bible convicts us and points out our sin. It is like a great floodlight that shines into a dark place to reveal and make manifest everything that is present, whether good or bad. The Bible reveals to us what is really in our heart, which the natural man (“the flesh”) tries to rationalise away, make excuses for, or even explicitly deny. The Bible is also to be used by the minister to lovingly reprove other believers when they are in error.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(397, 111, 'c)	<b>For correction.</b> The word used here is epanorthosis which literally means “straightening up again” or “correction.”  While reproof points out the sin, the Bible also gives us methods and measures by which we correct our thinking, and thus our actions and our lives. It straightens us up again if we begin to drift away from truth or from righteousness.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(398, 111, 'd)	<b>For instruction in righteousness.</b> The word “instruction” which Paul used here is the Greek paideia and it means “education” or “training.” It carries the sense of how parents would train their children so they can grow to become the kind of people they want them to be. God also educates and trains us through His Word so that we can live righteous lives that are pleasing and acceptable to Him. His ultimate standard for righteousness has been revealed in His Son Jesus our Saviour, who was made to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(399, 112, 'The perfection of the man of God is directly connected with him being “thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” The phrase “thoroughly furnished” is a Greek word exartizo which means to be “fully equipped.” It means something or someone has been enabled to meet all demands—excellent for all assignments. It means we are all-rounder and not cakes that areunturned like Ephraim (Hosea 7:8). This word was used to depict a ship that had previously been ill-equipped for travelling, but because its owner had decked it out with new equipment and gear, the ship had become thoroughly furnished to sail anywhere in the world. This boat has been fully supplied, completely equipped, or thoroughly furnished. Another illustration for this is a soldier at war. In the modern era, depending on his role, he would need to be furnished and equipped with weapons like an assault rifle, ammunition belt, hand grenade, emergency pistol, and dagger for close combat. But we get a spiritual parallel from the ancient Roman soldier, who was thoroughly furnished with the whole armour of God, as Paul illustrated (Eph. 6:10–18). Each item listed is very essential to the soldier’s victory, and each soldier’s victory is very essential to that of the whole army. “Thoroughly furnished” here thus means that every part of this army’s life is protected and no part is exposed to attack.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(400, 112, 'Bring both together, we can infer that being “thoroughly furnished” is to have it all complete in one such that we can exhibit the lives of the Lord Jesus Christ with utmost excellence at 100% mark in all facets of our lives. We can be wonderful children to our parents, gracious student at school, diligent workers at work,  excellent friend in our network, inspiring sibling to our family, excellent project planner for ministry works, prudent financial manager, benevolent giver, time maximiser, and a lifetime enhancers to all those who we mentor, among others. We can become the best in all sphere of life as the breath of the living Word takes His place in our lives unto perfection.', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(401, 112, 'The mandate of reasonable service requires a life that is all-round in grace. If the soldier is not equipped with the shield of faith before engaging the enemy, he has no way to defend himself from flying arrows and may not last long in battle before he is struck dead, even though he has other armour. If he does have everything except the sword of the Spirit, which is God’s Word, then he cannot attack the adversary but will continually be on the defensive, and no battle can be won with such imbalance. The breastplate guards the Christian’s heart from love waxing cold due to abounding iniquity in the ungodly world. The helmet protects the mind from false doctrines and deceptive spirits. The sandals preserve the soldier’s feet from becoming sore during battle, so he remains strong to continue taking the Gospel of peace wherever his feet lead him. Even a seemingly insignificant equipment such as the belt of truth is extremely important since it holds the soldier’s garments together and enables him to freely use the other weapons with agility. Everything must all come together for us to be reasonable vessels in the hands of God because a 0.01% exposure can mess up the whole!', '2018-02-20 11:06:18'),
(402, 113, 'In today’s Christianity, many pastors and ministers indeed preach God’s Word, but not with the right attitude or motive. Some preach sermons that appeal to the carnal desires of their congregation, to keep them coming back and bringing more tithes and offerings. Some establish churches nationwide and only preach with a desire to be famous and well-known. Others are actually in the ministry because they did not get admission on time or other areas of life did not work for them. Others preach for other reasons which do not agree with Scriptural truth. But Paul, in this passage, gave us the most important reason why we should preach God’s Word, \"Jesus is coming back soon to judge the earth, and the Scriptures have been given by God to prepare us through sound doctrine, reproof, correction, and education in righteousness.\" So a preacher must preach with a consciousness of the Lord Jesus Christ’s return. He must impart this same awareness to his audience and show them why it is necessary not just to hear the Word, but also to practically apply it to their daily lives. God’s Word says we must be doers of the Word, and not hearers only; otherwise we are only deceiving ourselves (James 1:22).', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(403, 113, 'Verse 1 of our text says that the Lord Jesus Christ shall judge “the quick and the dead.” The word “quick” is an Old English terminology derived from the Greek \"zao\" which means “alive” or “living.” Those who are alive at the Lord Jesus Christ’s return will be judged, as well as those who are dead by His return. At the rapture, those who are in the Lord Jesus Christ, both living and dead (1 Thess. 4:16–17), will be taken up with Him to receive rewards according to how they have served Him on earth (1 Cor. 3:11–15, 2 Cor. 5:10, Rev. 11:15–18), and after this they will be invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7–9). Those who are not in the Lord Jesus Christ will also be judged at His return. After the marriage supper of the righteous, the Lord and His heavenly army will return to judge those who were left behind on earth (Luke 17:26–30, Rev. 19:11–21). Finally, all the unrighteous, including those who were already dead before the Lord Jesus Christ’s return, will be eternally condemned at the second resurrection (Rev. 20:11–15).', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(404, 113, 'Those of us today who profess to belong to the Lord Jesus Christ must be very careful. This is because the Lord Jesus has said not everyone who calls Him Lord will enter His kingdom (see Matt. 7:21–23). Many will be convinced that they belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, but will be rejected when He returns, just as we read in the parable of the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1–13). All the virgins were waiting for the return of the Bridegroom, which is symbolic for Christians waiting for the Lord Jesus Christ. The five wise ones prepared themselves properly, but the foolish ones were unprepared. At the Lord’s return, those who were ready were received into the marriage, and “the door was shut” (Matt. 25:10). The other virgins prayed to be allowed in, but were denied (Matt. 25:11–13). After the rapture, those Christians who believed that they were all right with the Lord but in reality were unprepared, will be left behind with the unbelievers (Matt. 24:40–42). This is why Paul’s exhortation to Timothy was very critical. We are to preach the Word because the Scriptures are given to prepare us for the Lord Jesus Christ, through sound doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(405, 113, 'We can safely say that one of the most important reasonable services is to preach with a consciousness of the Lord Jesus Christ’s return: to prepare us for the marriage of the Lamb and our eternal cohabitation with the Lord.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(406, 114, 'Many admonitions to Timothy in this portion of the epistle emphasise his need to be consistent in reasonable service and in the fulfilling of his ministry. First, Paul said he must be “instant in season, out of season.” What could this possibly mean? The word “instant” is a Greek word \"ephistemi\" which literally means to “stand upon.” It means to take a firm stand or remain in position, a term borrowed from the military that meant to stay at one’s post. So Paul was charging Timothy (and us) to remain steadfast in our position in the Lord Jesus Christ, to stand firm in our office and in our calling. He also said that this should be done “in season and out of season,” which in Greek root means \"in good times and in bad times.\" As Christians, we are to stand firm in our calling, whether in good times or in bad times, when it is convenient and when it is inconvenient, when there is peace and when there is persecution or tribulation. We are to stay at our post and remain consistent under all circumstances without compromise. Whether things work the way we desire or not, we are under a mandate to stand at our duty post for the Lord.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(407, 114, 'In addition, we must reprove, rebuke, and exhort others with all long-suffering and doctrine. This can only be done properly using God’s written Word. Any preaching that does not help people to build the consciousness of the Lord Jesus Christ\'s return through rebuke or correction is nothing but a comedy show. We must use God’s Word not to entertain or excite but to drive in godliness through reporting, rebuking, and exhortation. This must, however, be built on doctrine and it requires consistency over a long period (long-suffering), as we patiently watch the word grow in the lives of our listeners.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(408, 114, 'In verse 5, Paul also said, “watch thou in all things.” The word “watch” is the Greek nepho and it means to remain sober and careful, to be vigilant and discreet. The enemy attempts to knock us off from our mission on earth, so we must be cautious and not let him succeed in destroying our witness and our ministry. Then Paul said, “endure afflictions,” which is the same as kakopatheo “endure hardship” (2 Tim. 2:3) and “suffer trouble” (2 Tim. 2:9). It means we must continue to persevere through any trials or challenging times. Our service to the Lord must not be hindered due to external difficulties, but we must remain faithful in all things. The next exhortation is to “do the work of an evangelist,” derived from the Greek word euaggelistes which literally means “a preacher of the Good News, that is, the Gospel.” The work of an evangelist is to preach the Gospel to everyone. This could be individual persons or a gathering of people. The historical truth of the Lord Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:3–4) must be communicated to others, as this is the power of God unto salvation to those who will believe (Rom. 1:16). Every Christian is an evangelist to one degree or another, though some have been specifically called to that office on a large scale (Eph. 4:11). Finally, Paul said to Timothy and all Christians: “make full proof of thy ministry” (2 Tim. 4:5). The phrase “full proof” is a Greek word plerophoreo which means “to carry out fully” or “accomplish entirely.” It means that we must see to it that we fulfil and thoroughly complete the assignment which God has given us to do for Him on earth. We are called for 100% delivery of the reason why God created and redeemed us.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(409, 114, 'We must endeavour to use everything He has made available to us to continue pressing forward in the successful completion of our calling.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(410, 115, 'We are under obligation to preach the Word, but it is equally important that we hear the Word. In verses 3–4, Paul guaranteed that there would be times when professing Christians will not endure sound doctrine. That word “endure” is the Greek anechomai and it means, “to put up with.” He is saying that many believers will be tired or fed up with the basic truths of the Bible, maybe due to boredom of hearing the same things over and over, or a desire to hear some new exciting stuff.', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(411, 115, 'So “after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears”. They will begin to lust (desire) for a “higher” or more exciting spiritual revelation, but instead of seeking God’s face, they will go after teachers who impart something different that arouses curiosity and are completely the opposite of what the Lord Jesus is and represents. This inevitably turns them away from the truth and deludes them into believing fables [mythos = “fiction,” “myth”] (2 Tim. 4:4). The absolute necessity of abiding in Biblical truth cannot be overstated. Many seducing spirits use human vessels to spread doctrines of demons. If we are not careful, we will find ourselves allowing and indulging in such doctrines and erroneous beliefs. One of the most popular of these today is once-saved-always-saved, which argues that a Christian cannot backslide and we do not need to confess our sins and that once we have made a sinner’s prayer, we are completely free to live anyhow!', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),
(412, 115, 'The Lord Jesus has said that He is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15). The branches must remain connected and abide in the vine to be of any use in fruit bearing, since all the nourishment comes from the roots and stem of the main tree (John 15:5). But those who do not remain in the Lord Jesus Christ will be cast out as branches; and a branch separated from the main tree cannot bear fruit, but withers away. The Lord Jesus says that they will not be good for anything else but to be burnt in the fire (John 15:6). This is the grave danger of “having itching ears” and departing from the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul already warned Timothy that some would depart from the faith in the latter times (1 Tim. 4:1). It is a bad prophecy that must not find fulfilment in our lives. ', '2018-02-20 11:11:46'),

(414, 116, 'Before a person can give his all, and invest his life into a particular endeavour, he must first be fully persuaded that the cause is worth sacrificing his entire future for, before he can commit to it wholeheartedly. We cannot effectively fight the good fight, keep the faith, and finish our course to the very end, if we do not first make up our minds to give our all to the Lord Jesus Christ. Giving our all to Christ is an offering. It is an offering from the day you accepted Him as Lord, until the day your soul leaves your body to go on to be with Him (2 Cor. 5:8). Paul said, “I am now ready to be offered.” He was approaching the end of his earthly life. The word “offered” is a Greek word spendo which literally means “to pour out as a drink offering.” Paul was saying, as his death was drawing closer, his soul (or his spirit) was prepared to be poured out as a drink offering, to be received into the bosom of the Lord Jesus Christ. Throughout the Law of Moses, a drink offering usually accompanied the meal offering and animal sacrifices, as a complete gesture of giving back to God everything that was already rightfully His to begin with (see Num. 15:7, 1 Chron. 29:13–14). Our lives do not actually belong to us, but was originally given to us by God (Acts 17:25). Paul had full understanding of this and, therefore, saw his impending execution for the Gospel’s sake as only pouring out the life back to the original Owner and Giver.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(415, 116, 'He signified, “the time of my departure is at hand” (2 Tim. 4:6). From Paul’s words, we can note that death is not a cessation of existence, but a departure of the spirit (the real person) from the body. Death has never been the end of the person’s existence, but only the person’s eventual departure from his earthly body. Paul said that he had a desire to depart and to be with the Lord Jesus Christ, which is far better (Phil. 1:23). And now the time of that departure was finally at hand. It is time to close the chapter of a gracious life that was spent for the course of eternity.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),

TACEF\'s annual theme focus for 2017 plainly states that we should offer ourselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable unto God, which is our reasonable service (Rom. 12:1). This is what it means to give our life to Christ. A Christian’s time, money, energy, and resources must be dedicated to the risen Saviour, in humble service and joyful obedience. It is only as we offer our lives in service unto Him now in this present time, that we can pour it out at the very end as a drink offering which the Lord will receive into His heavenly presence. May we live a life that is worthy to be poured as a drink offering for the Lord. As every one of us desires drink with good taste, so will the Lord only be pleased with lives whose drink offering is sweet unto the Lord.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(417, 117, 'Paul gave us three areas that a Christian who desires to finish well must experience. These experiences involve courage, consistency, and the crown.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(418, 117, 'a)	<b>Courage in service.</b> The first dimension in service which the Christian must experience is courage, as Paul said, “I have fought a good fight.” The Apostle Paul was a very courageous man. Catching a glimpse of the Lord Jesus in glory gave him all the boldness and motivation he needed to take the Gospel into the most dangerous regions of the earth at a total risk to his life. Reading from Acts 13 to 28 and observing his epistles, we see Paul’s fearlessness in the face of danger, adversity, and death. He knew that the One who had called him to preach the Gospel to the nations was Supreme over all, and that his own life was in the hands of the Supreme God. He was too sure of His source that nothing hindered him from going far in his conviction and calling. No wonder, he advised Timothy and all Christians to “war a good warfare” (1 Tim. 1:18), “fight the good fight of faith” (1 Tim. 6:12), and be “good soldiers of Jesus Christ” (2 Tim. 2:3). This is the only life that we have and it is only worth any value if it is lived for the Owner. This requires courage, and without courage we will not be able to experience the second dimension—consistency.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(419, 117, 'b)	<b>Consistency.</b> Paul said, “I have kept the faith” and “I have finished my course.” These are marks of a consistent individual. The word “kept” is the Greek tereo which means to “guard.” It means to be faithful in retaining and maintaining the principles of the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and living a lifestyle that reflects that faith. It is a life that is on fire for God on campus and still maintains same consecration when going home on holiday, even when there is no one to encourage or look up to. It is a life that is on fire as a single sister, whose passion for God does not die like a malfunctioning battery in marriage. Consistency is a pursuit of God that stands the test of time, location, or situation.<br/>\r\nPaul said he had finished his “course,” that word in the original Greek is dromos which literally means a “race.” The Christian race is not a 100-metre sprint, but a stretched out marathon. A marathon is a long race that requires the runner to cleverly pace himself to remain consistent and never run out of energy until he reaches the finish line. Starting well is comparatively easy, but finishing well is a different kind of challenge. For example, it is easy to begin a weight reduction programme with so much energy on Days 1–15 with consistent dieting and rigorous exercise, which, unfortunately, dies off in the second month as if one never started at all, when the temptations of mouth-watering food comes. Many never complete the program. <br/>\r\nIt is also easy to get married after a most exciting courtship, but more challenging to continue through the personality incompatibilities that may be discovered during the course of the marriage. Many marriages end in painful divorce. But Christians are called to persevere and remain consistent until we finish our course. We must stand true to our calling, marriage, academic pursuit, career, and commitments. Being saved is only the beginning; we still have to go through the difficulties of this world, defeat temptations, and deal with trials and even persecution. The Lord Jesus has said that “strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life” (Matt. 7:14). So we first enter through the gate, but must also travel the path to the end. This requires consistency, and our faithfulness in being consistent leads to the third dimension of experience.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(420, 117, 'c)	<b>Crown.</b> The Christian’s courage and consistency will eventually lead to the Christian’s crown. Paul said, “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness” (2 Tim. 4:8). This may be a literal crown, or it may be a figurative term representing honour and dignity, or it may be both, since the Greek word permits it. “Crown” is the word stephanos, which means a chaplet or wreath, which was a circular band adorned with flowers and ornaments that the winner of the Ancient Greek Olympic received.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(421, 117, 'But Paul also mentioned that all those who love and anticipate the Lord’s return to earth will also receive crowns (2 Tim. 4:8). This means that although all true Christians will be saved, not all will have crowns reserved for them by the Lord.

(422, 118, 'The foundation of salvation is the Lord Jesus Christ, but we can build a number of different works upon that foundation, which Paul represented as gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble (1 Cor. 3:12). Paul further said that there are rewards for those whose works abide (1 Cor. 3:14), but those whose works are burnt will lose their reward, though they themselves shall still be saved (1 Cor. 3:15). With this understanding, we can see also that there are five different kinds of crowns mentioned in the New Testament, and Christians will be rewarded accordingly. While the attributes of these crowns may apply to all believers to a certain degree, the crowns remain special epitomes in various archetypes as explored below:', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(423, 118, 'a)	<b>Crown of rejoicing.</b> Paul mentioned a “crown of rejoicing” (1 Thess. 2:19). Although, as we said already, all the attributes of these crowns apply across the board, yet each crown that carries each attribute represents a hallmark or height of that particular attribute. There is nothing but joy in God’s kingdom, but this special crown of rejoicing, signifying a “fullness of joy” (Ps. 16:11). This crown is only reserved for those who have won many souls for the Lord Jesus Christ, because we are told about how joy erupts in heaven over one single sinner that repents (Luke 15:7).', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(424, 118, 'b)	<b>Crown of righteousness.</b> This is the crown which Paul spoke of in our text (2 Tim. 4:8). Righteousness is twofold: First, we are declared righteous and justified by the Lord Jesus, and His own righteousness is imputed unto us (2 Cor. 5:21). Secondly, God also requires practical righteousness from His people in our daily lives (Luke 1:75, 1 John 3:7). Though all are declared righteous by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, this special crown is reserved for those Christians who have laboured and toiled in practical righteousness in their lives and service unto God.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(425, 118, 'c)	<b>Crown of glory.</b> We read about this crown (1 Pet. 5:4), which is reserved only for genuinely labouring church leaders, as Peter indicated (1 Pet. 5:1–3). These are the leaders who rule well, and labour in the word and doctrine, as Paul mentioned to Timothy (1 Tim. 5:17).', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(426, 118, 'd)	<b>Imperishable crown.</b> Paul mentioned a crown that is “incorruptible” (1 Cor. 9:24-25). That word in the Greek is aphthartos, which means undecaying or imperishable. Those who contend for earthly prizes are rewarded with corruptible crowns, which are temporary and will eventually perish. But the Christian’s crown which he receives from the Lord, depending on his life and service, will last forever without decaying or decomposing. The Lord Jesus warned us not to focus on storing up earthly treasures because they are corruptible (Matt. 6:19), and Peter spoke of an incorruptible inheritance which has been reserved in heaven for God’s faithful people (1 Pet. 1:3–4). Since Paul used the analogy of a dedicated runner who disciplines himself to obtain the prize, this incorruptible crown thus is for any Christian who exercises discipline and self-denial from things that hinder him from fully pleasing God.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(427, 118, 'e)	<b>Crown of life.</b> This crown is spoken about in James 1:12 and Revelation 2:10. In both verses, the situation has to do with Christians being “tried,” which is synonymous with undergoing temptations and tribulations. In Revelation 2:10 in particular, the Lord Jesus says “be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” There are clear indications that the church in Smyrna was undergoing serious persecution, even to the point of believers being killed (Rev. 2:8–10). The Lord Jesus assured them that he “was dead, and is alive” (Rev. 2:8). The crown of life, therefore, points to those who were martyred and suffered premature death for their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. All that are in the Lord Jesus Christ certainly have eternal life, but special honour will be granted to His martyrs.', '2018-02-20 16:08:43'),
(428, 119, 'A number of people forsook Paul when he became a prisoner of the Roman government, especially during his second incarceration under Nero’s reign. The first striking observation in our text is verse 10: “Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.” This is worth mentioning by Paul because he once recognised Demas as his “fellow labourer” (Philem. 1:24), mentioning his name alongside people like Mark and Luke (Col. 4:14). In other words, Demas was a trusted Christian who had worked together with Paul in the ministry, and thus it is a most shocking reality that a man who was a shoulder to lean on forsook him at a most critical time in his life. Like every genuine father, he was disappointed that the once faithful man had now chosen to abandon him. The former companion had now forsaken him, and the former lover of Christ had now loved this present world.', '2018-02-20 16:17:31'),
(429, 119, 'But the issue was even more complex. Not only did people forsook Paul but they also departed from the faith and turned to be his enemies. He spoke of a man called Alexander, a coppersmith, who did him “much” evil, and greatly withstood the Word of God (2 Tim. 4:14–15). We have every indication to believe that this is the same Alexander in Acts 19:33 and 1 Timothy 1:20. In Acts 19:23–34, there was a riot at Ephesus caused by silversmiths who made shrines for the goddess Diana. Alexander was the man in verse 33 who acted as a mediator between the believers and the rioting Ephesian silversmiths, since he was also a coppersmith. Also, the first epistle was written to Timothy after Paul left him at Ephesus to put the church in order (1 Tim. 1:3), and Alexander is said to have put away his faith (1 Tim. 1:19-20). No doubt, this was the same Alexander who did Paul some kind of evil and became an opponent of the Gospel. Another big disappointment for Paul.', '2018-02-20 16:17:31'),

This was why Paul prayed that their forsaking of him should not be laid to their charge. <b>He forgave them prayerfully.</b> He did not pray that they fall down and die, but he stood as their advocate, asking the Lord not to count it against them.

In Hebrews 13:5–6, the writer repeated the Lord Jesus’ promise by combining two passages from the Old Testament (Josh. 1:5, Ps. 118:6). Paul had this concrete assurance—the reason why he could speak the way he did (2 Tim. 4:17–18).

It is safe to prepare our hearts for a time when our best friends, most intimate family members, closest spiritual networks, prayer partners, and those we have laboured on turned their backs against us. It is better to  prepare in advance and forgive ahead of time. The meaning of the word \"forgive\" is actually \"before give,\" meaning before an offense is committed against us, we should let it go in advance. It is a future preparation, as it will necessarily happen just as the Lord Jesus had already told us, \"for it must needs be that offences come” (Matt. 18:7).

This was towards the end of Paul’s life, but ironically, Mark was someone Paul had rejected from working with him in ministry as a companion on his first missionary tour with Barnabas (Acts 13:2–5). We have the account that he forsook Paul and Barnabas in Pamphylia probably at a time when ministerial demands were high (Acts 15:38).

All of us have a lesson to learn from this. We should not give up on people too easily, but remember that we are all human and can make mistakes. The members of Christ’s body need one another (1 Cor. 12:21–22), and the Lord Jesus Himself emphasised reconciliation (Matt. 6:14, 18:15). However, we must also be interested in knowing why Paul said he was now beneficial. He was formerly said to be inefficient for service but now very beneficial. Something must have changed! It must be that Mark had worked on himself. He had proved himself again and convinced Paul that he had gotten better. He must be a man who did not take offense when a leader corrected him. He must be a man who accepted his fault and committed to win back lost confidence. He was a man who took his past mistakes seriously and consciously made amends to a point that he became a choice vessel of huge beneficial value. <b>What is our attitude when chastised? Do we get better or bitter or even grow blisters?</b> Do we avoid, ignore, disregard, and cut off from our own \"Paul,\" who had previously rejected us because of a past disappointment?

Instead, aged and incarcerated, he was still consumed with thoughts of the ministry and preaching the Word!

Erastus was one of such (2 Tim. 4:20, Rom. 16:23). He was a chamberlain or a treasurer of the city of Cenchreae in Corinth, from whence the epistle to the Romans was written (Rom. 16:23). This may or may not be the same Erastus who ministered to Paul along with Timothy (Acts 19:22). We can note  that the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts was also a finance minister of his country.

It will be wrong for a leader to tell his follower, \"You don\'t have faith,\" when an individual, who has been nursing a critical medical condition for a few days humbly and genuinely requests to be excused from a long-fasting period. Of course, this does not mean that brethren should now focus on their sickness and lose sight of the power of God to heal or use this as an excuse to forget their altar of personal relationship with God.

The\r\nsearch could have ended right there and then, and Darius could have concluded that the\r\nJews were liars, probably worthy of severe punishment for making false claims using king\r\nCyrus\' name. However, God\'s divine providence was not going to allow that to happen!\r\nHe will not allow His name to be brought into disrepute.

He also ordered that animals and ingredients needed for offerings to God\r\nshould be made available to the Jews (6:9). Again, this shows us God\'s Hand in the\r\nmatter, because Darius could have concluded that the commandment to help the Jews\r\nfinancially and materially was ordered under Cyrus\' reign, and Darius could easily have\r\nseen no responsibility on his part. Further confirmation is seen in 6:10, where Darius has\r\nexpectation that his goodness will be recognised and reciprocated through the Jews\'\r\nprayers for him and his sons.

At\r\nthe completion and dedication of the second temple, it was necessary for the Israelites to\r\nexpress their gratitude towards God not only verbally but also by offering sacrifices on the\r\naltar. Verse 17 shows us that not only Judah, Benjamin, and Levi were represented, but\r\nIsraelites from all the twelve tribes. About 712 animals were offered altogether, a meagre\r\nfigure in comparison to the total number of animals offered at the dedication of Solomon\'s\r\ntemple (142,000...1Kings 8:63).', '2018-12-03 19:56:31'),
(570, 160, 'However, before God, the quantity of the offerings is not the most important thing, but the\r\nHEART of the giver(s) behind the offering. God is very keen about the spirit behind our\r\nsacrifices and not the volume. Jesus pointed this out in Luke 21:1-4, when He declared that\r\nthe poor widow who cast in two mites had done better than the wealthy. She gave her all, but\r\nthey only gave a small fraction of their abundance. Revival will require us giving our all to the\r\nwork of the Lord both spiritually and materially. Giving requires a heart that is right with the\r\nLord. If our hearts are right, then what weoffer will be acceptable to God. Cain\'s offering was\r\nrejected, not because he was a farmer who brought the natural fruit of his labour in contrast\r\nto Abel who was a shepherd, but because his HEART was not right with God (Gen. 4:5-7). As\r\nlong as his heart was not surrendered to God, whatever he had to offer was of secondary\r\nimportance.<b>Revival is a game of the heart and any sacrificial service that does not come\r\nfrom the heart is never acceptable.</b>', '2018-12-03 19:56:31'),
(571, 160, 'If we desire to see the true flames of revival ignited, then we must offer our entire beings to\r\nGod in holiness and righteousness. We have learnt that our most reasonable service is to\r\noffer ourselves as living sacrifices unto the Lord (Rom. 12:1-2).', '2018-12-03 19:56:31'),
(572, 161, 'Throughout history, God has always wanted His people to be separated from uncleanness.\r\nThe popular words “consecrated” and “sanctified” carry the meanings of not just holiness or\r\npurity, but also mean to be set apart. After the temple was completed, it was also dedicated.\r\nThe word \'dedication\' (6:16-17) is the Hebrew-Aramaic word Hanukkah, which means \'an\r\ninitiation unto consecration\'. It means that something (or someone) has become set apart or\r\ndedicated for the service of God. The thing or the person has now been separated from other\r\npurposes unto one particular purpose (in this case, the worship and service of God). This is\r\nwhy Jesus was offended when He saw that the temple was being used for other purposes\r\nsuch as business (buying & selling animals for sacrifice, and money exchange) in John 2:13-\r\n16, instead of its sole purpose of being a house of prayer which is a form of worship (Matt.\r\n21:13).', '2018-12-03 19:56:31'),

The same must be done for the corporate\r\nchurch which is now being reduced to a business venture. It is a sad story today when a\r\nminister is posted to a church with an underlying objective to use such minister to raise\r\nmoney. It is sad when we measure the success of a church or a growing parish by how much\r\nmoney they have and not by how many souls have been won to the Lord. “Ye cannot serve\r\nGod and mammon” (Matt. 6:24).

It opened the doors for Jerusalem as a city to be rebuilt along with its\r\nwalls, and it paved the way for the Jews to be re-established as a legitimate nation in their\r\nown land with a place to connect to God. This is the same parallel of what Jesus did for\r\nthe Church 2,000 years ago when he laid the foundation of the church. His death was not the\r\nend but the beginning of greater things to come.

(576, 162, 'The Church remains strong and still standing, although throughout the Church age there\r\nhave been several challenges for the house of God.

Today\'s generation of Christians should be aware of the prophecies\r\nand promises of God that there will be a second outpouring (the “latter rain”) before our Lord\r\nand Saviour returns to this earth. Joel 2:28-32 is where the prophecy of the first outpouring is\r\nfound, which was fulfilled at Pentecost, as Peter expressly confirmed (Acts 2:16-21). Hosea\r\n6:1-3 mentions another prophecy that says God will come to us as the latter and former rain.\r\nThis indicates that the Outpouring prophecy of Joel 2 was only partially fulfilled at Pentecost\r\nin Acts 2 (the \'former rain\'), but there will also be an Outpouring of the latter rain right before\r\nJesus returns, which will bring unusual signs and wonders with it\'s coming (Joel 2:30-31). This\r\nis the understanding that captures the burden of revival that TACEF has for our generation\r\nand we believe this outpouring will happen soon to lead many unto the Lord in preparation\r\nfor the final harvest.

Ezra was born\r\nand raised in Babylon, he must have been a man after God\'s own heart in similar fashion as\r\nDavid. This is because of the way he is spoken of in chapter 7. He rejected the Babylonian\r\nsystem and sought the way of God of Israel. Even though he was born in Babylon and has\r\nnever been to Jerusalem, he has a longing for the city of the Lord. Verse 10 of our passage\r\nreveals a three-step procedure which enabled Ezra to become an agent of revival in his\r\ngeneration.

(579, 163, '<ol>\r\n<li>Set the heart to seek the word of God:“For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the\r\nLaw of the LORD.”This is the beginning of every revival move—a heart for God. The\r\nword “heart” in the Hebrew was recognised as the central organ in a human body\r\nand therefore represented the innermost being of a person. The Jews used the word\r\nto denote a person\'s deepest desires, thoughts, and intentions. So, we see that\r\nEzra\'s heart was “prepared” (literally, “set”) to seek God\'s Word. This reminds us of\r\nDaniel, who purposed in his heart to follow God\'s Law (Dan. 1:8). The word \'seek\' is\r\nthe Hebrew darash and it means to tread passionately, follow after, pursue, or\r\nsearch. Ezra pushed all distractions aside and set his heart to persistently dive into\r\nthe Scriptures and bring out the life of God in His word. He is like the man in Psalm\r\n1:1-2...”Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor\r\nstandeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful; But his delight is\r\nin the Law of the LORD, and in His Law does he meditate day and night.” He was\r\nwholeheartedly committed to God\'s Word.</li>', '2018-12-03 20:08:34'),

Verse 25 of that passage in\r\nJames says that those who look into the perfect law of liberty and do what is\r\ncontained therein will be blessed in their deeds. No wonder Ezra was blessed in his\r\ndeed, and obtained favour from God with the king, successfully leading a mass\r\nrevival from Babylon to the holy city of Jerusalem!\r\nThe DOING of God\'s Word is indispensable and cannot be replaced or substituted\r\nwith anything else. All forms of praise and worship, prayer and fasting, are short circuited\r\nif there is no obedience to the will of God. David said,“I delight to do your\r\nwill, O my God.

Act1:1 mentions\r\nthat Jesus began both to “do and teach” during His earthly ministry. So, there is order\r\nto the procedure of revival, with teaching being the last nail in the coffin of the\r\nspiritual enemies of revival. The temple had been completed and dedicated six\r\ndecades prior to Ezra\'s arrival, with offerings and worship being observed steadily,\r\nbut proper exposition of the Scripture had been missing. Ezra was a “ready” scribe in\r\nthe Law of Moses (v. 6). That word in the Hebrew is mahir which means skilled or\r\nskilful. The word also means quick or rapid. In other words, Ezra became skilled and\r\nquick asa result of his wholehearted seeking and performing.

(583, 164, 'God on multiple occasions has used ordinary men to lead people out of apathy into\r\nawakening and renewed consciousness of who He is. This time, that man would be Ezra.\r\nBecause Ezra was a seeker, doer, and teacher of God\'s Word, the Lord granted him\r\nrecognition by the king, who in turn granted more Israelites freedom to go up to Jerusalem\r\nwith him (v. 11-13). Verses 7-9 of chapter 7 give a summary of how the Israelites went on the\r\nfour-month journey with Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem, while chapter 8 gives the full\r\ndetails. It is amazing how God can use one surrendered heart to draw so many people unto\r\nHimself, after activating His word in the heart of that individual.There is no revival without\r\nmen in whose lives the word of God has become a living experience. The implication of a\r\nword-filled life was captured in the parallel of the sower (God), good ground (heart) and seed\r\n(word of God). We saw here that only the good ground (that is, the good heart) retained the\r\nWord and brought positive results (Luke 8:15). Some thirty fold, some sixty fold, some a\r\nhundred fold (Matt. 13:23). A sown seed (word)must multiply and bring forth more, so also\r\nthose who have prepared their hearts to receive, do, and teach God\'s Word will bring a\r\nmultiplication of people into God\'s harvest. This is the essence of personal and corporate\r\nrevivals. This is why the Word of Christ must dwell in us richly in all wisdom (Col. 3:16). Jesus\r\nsaid,“If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you want, and it shall\r\nbe done unto you” (John 15:7).

But the other descendants of Levi who were not of the Aaronic lineage were simply\r\ncalled \'Levites\', and they were helpers of the priests with temple work such as gatekeeping\r\n(porters), washing the instruments used for killing and preparing offerings, playing musical\r\ninstruments, etc.<br/>\r\nEzra and his company abode by the Ahava River in Babylon for three days, and during that\r\ntime he identified some priests, but could not find any Levites. Perhaps the Levites did not\r\nwant to leave Babylon to go and engage in ancestral responsibilities of the temple. They were\r\nindifferent to the call of God, but that did not discourage Ezra. He saw the necessity of\r\nsending people out to go and inspire these Levites to be partakers of the revival mandate. He\r\nmade a leadership step of searching for more men rather than lament that there were no\r\nmen. Ezra initiated a local outreach of eleven men to go to Casiphia, a place in Babylon,\r\nwhere Levites could be sought out and recruited (v. 16-17). He was very focused and knew\r\nwhere to go. Sometimes there are potential men and women of God who will remain idle or\r\nindifferent to their calling until someone wakes them up. Our local fellowships are full of\r\npotential servants of God, but we must embark on local outreaches to find these people and\r\nbring them on board for the journey of revival.<br/>\r\nJesus was one man who started a local outreach to recruit labourers for the spiritual harvest.\r\nHe started by first calling two ordinary fishermen, Andrew and Peter, with the popular quote\r\n“I will make you fishers of men”. He called two more fishermen (James and John...Mark 1:16-\r\n20), before assembling the twelve, who were comprised of people from different walks of\r\nlife, including a tax collector. These would become His main agents whom He would use to\r\nspread the preaching of the Kingdom (Luke 9:1-6), before sending an additional seventy for\r\nfurther revival ministry (Luke 10:1-12). There is still a great need for local outreach today.\r\nCongregational Christianity where we gather once or twice a week is good, but we need\r\nteams of dedicated people (like the eleven whom Ezra sent), that will go into the local\r\nhouseholds to identify more men and women to invest in and commission for the work of\r\nthe kingdom.

(641, 180, 'One of the critical levers of leadership as seen here is vision. Vision is a clear picture of the\r\ndesired future. It is the sense of a destination. Vision is the fuel of revival. Nehemiah had a\r\nclear vision to rebuild the walls of the city of Jerusalem and this was birthed by God. It was\r\nnot a personal agenda or spontaneous thought of a selfish desire. It came through as a\r\nburden and was crystallised in prayer and fasting. It was a download from heaven and\r\nconfirmed by God Himself. This reminds every TACEFite how the vision to “raise an army with\r\na vision of revival” came. The pioneers had a burden of the need for a change in the church at\r\nthat time and this could have been expressed in many ways. E.g. they could have started a\r\npreaching society, organised a revival programme, enrolled at a college of theology to\r\nbecome ministers or left the church altogether, but they went the way of Nehemiah which is\r\nto labour in prayer and fasting until the burden grew into God\'s own vision with specific\r\ndivine instruction on what is to be done, how it should be done, where it will be done and\r\nwhy it must be done. This will also include with whom it will be done and when it must start.\r\nEvery vision of God must pass through this structured phase that is beyond a feeling or\r\nemotion but God-birthed instructions plus a clear sense of the destination. This process of\r\nenvisioning is very important because many people have acted only on emotional burden\r\nand have wasted away because there was no clarity as to what was to be done and the sense\r\nof the measure of success. Burden alone is not enough if the breath of God has not come\r\nupon it to become God\'s own series of instructions and long-term picture of resultscalled\r\nvision. This only comes from the Holy spirit. For TACEF vision to evolve, many days of longterm\r\nfasting, daily prayers and vigils were spent to activate the burden, download specific\r\ndetails, understand God\'s ultimate plan and develop these into a well-articulated vision on\r\nhow to address a gap which has consequences on issues of eternity of a people.', '2018-12-04 07:21:21'),

In Habakkuk\r\n2:2, we read these words: “And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make\r\nit plain upon tablets, that he may run that reads it.” God Himself wants us to be very clear\r\nabout our focus, hence the need to document because it is easier to communicate what is\r\nintently expressed in written format. Writing down the necessary steps that need to be taken\r\nwill motivate and propel us into continual action until the goal is realised.

In\r\nthe previous chapter, he had showed them what he wanted to do, and the rulers and\r\ncommon people all agreed that it was a good work to be accomplished (2:16-18). The first\r\nperson mentioned in chapter 3 who started his allocated portion of the work is the high\r\npriest himself, Eliashib, along with the other priests (3:1). Looking through the long list, we\r\nfind that Nehemiah had wisely allocated many people to work on parts of the wall that were\r\nclose to their houses. The people who did this work also included people from different\r\nwalks of life such as perfume makers, merchants, and goldsmiths.

In our\r\nannual study of Exodus, we saw how Moses was wearing himself out from morning till\r\nevening judging all of Israel alone by himself. His father-in-law Jethro gave him godly counsel\r\nto delegate work to competent men, and handle only the difficult cases himself. He followed\r\nthe advice and employed overseers (Ex. 18:13-26).

For emphasis, the word, “repent” in Greek is “metanoia” which means a change of mind/heart/purpose. True repentance in its original definition means a complete change of direction. This involves a turning from sin with contrition to God.

The main issue is that we trespassed against man and God. If our repentance is genuine, we would seek to right our wrongs no matter how small.

The error in this line of thinking is that there is no forgiveness from God for an unrepentant soul.

This is backward thinking! Demons are NOT to be feared! Jesus was never afraid of any demon and neither were His disciples. God is the Creator of all things while the demons are created beings. They have evil powers, no doubt about it, but as a Christian you have full authority through the name of Jesus to cast them out. Greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world (1st John 4:4). Demons fear God and tremble (James 2:19), and God lives inside each believer as the Holy Spirit. He has given us authority over them. The seventy disciples returned with joy saying to the Lord “even the devils are subject to us through thy name” (Luke 10:17).

But this is not what it means to seek God’s will. We must give up on our own plan for our life and earnestly become ready to do what God Himself would have us do. Isaiah 55:8-9:, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” You may want to be a doctor, while God wants something else for you. You may want to live in some area of town, while God intends for you to live elsewhere and serve Him. You may want to marry Sister X or Brother Y because of beauty, exposure, education and family background,  while God has prepared someone of great value for our outside your own measurement yardstick.

Jesus said, “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit (John 12:24)”. We must die to our own will so that we can bear much fruit by walking in God’s will, which He has in mind for us. He that saves his life shall lose it, but he that loses his life in order to follow God’s will shall save it (see Matt. 16:25).

He tells us in Psalm 46:10: “Be still, and know that I am God.” If you find yourself in a place in life, where you have to make a decision but are unsure of what to do, just wait on God faithfully each day, until He gives you a word. Habakkuk said “I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved” (Hbk. 2:1). This man knew the importance of waiting on the Lord. Now look at verse 2: “and the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run who reads it...” So, he waited in stillness and quietness for a word from the LORD, and God finally answered him. Verse 20 gives us some good advice if we want similar results: “But the LORD is in His holy temple; Let all the earth keep silence before Him.”','2018-10-31 10:21:50');

Elijah thought it was over for him. He was in a state of confusion in the wilderness, but God’s voice assured him that it was not over and he still had more work to do (verses 15-18).

Daniel, for example, was counted as one of the wise men of Babylon. None of the wise men could tell King Nebuchadnezzar what his dream was, nor interpret it to him. He was furious and decided to kill them all. Daniel knew he had to hear from God to get the answer. God heard his petition and gave him the answer in a night vision while he was sleeping (Dan. 2:19-23). God still speaks to us through dreams.','2018-10-31 10:23:50');

There have been many reports lately of even Muslims testifying that Jesus appeared to them in their dreams, and they thus converted to Christianity. He reveals Himself to those who seek Truth with the whole heart. Jesus also said He would manifest Himself to those who obey His commands (John 14:21). Like Daniel, He will give us the answer we seek. Remember that Daniel was a God-fearing man, who obeyed God and even denied himself of the king’s delicacies (Dan. 1:8).

However, we are also told to prove all things, and accept what is good. Only the Holy Spirit who lives within us can enable us to discern the spirits (1 Cor 12:10, 1 John 4:1). If the word which a man or woman speaks to you is from God, the Spirit of God within you will acknowledge and confirm its genuineness. If it is a false prophet, the same Spirit of God will warn you. But we must never throw away the baby with the bathwater. Yes there are fakes, but the genuine ones are here amongst us also. 1st Corinthians 12 is a passage for the entire body of Christ, and Paul lists prophecy as one of the spiritual gifts for Christians so this applies today in the 21st century as much as it did in the 1st century, and there will continue to be those gifted with prophecy until Jesus returns for His church.','2018-10-31 10:26:50');

If you go to a wrong person and obey what they tell you to do, you will make an even worse shipwreck of your circumstance. We are to depend on God first before anyone else. Seek direction by carefully looking into His Word. Get in a quiet place and pray. Ask God for the answer.

This is sad and troubling. Horoscopes are forms of astrology, which is something God condemned, and forbade the children of Israel from practicing.

A yoke is a wooden bar put across the neck of two animals to hold them together for the purpose of ploughing. Thus, a yoke does not allow you to do what you like. It forces you to walk in the same step as the other fellow with whom you are yoked. So, Jesus Christ is willing to be yoked together with you and make you what He want you to be.

In those days, once a man was condemned to die by the cross, it had to be outside the gate, on a land where nobody stayed, a place deserted and void of living. Today, the cross is associated with symbol of death like that of obituary notice marked with the cross. Jesus had to be crucified for our sins.

He sacrificed everything for us. His life, title, rank, privileges, comforts, security and power. He emptied Himself. He obeyed to the point of death, even the death of the cross. So, bearing our cross deals with willingly sacrificing ourselves, our wants, desires and needs for the things of God. It is being willing to lose our lives for His sake. It is a sacrifice to defeat temptation of all kinds when our nature cries out for instant gratification be it for immorality, materialism, too much food, gossip etc.  In Gal 2:20, Paul says "l have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer l who live, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me". Can we boldly say with Paul, 'l no longer live, but Christ lives in me"? Are you willing to give up what the world has to offer you?

He is both engaged in the theory and practical of the course right from the introductory periods in the secondary school till he completes his tertiary learning. In the same manner, discipleship entails a special, systematic and cumulative system of learning under a master. This trend can be found in the Old Testament as the relationship between Moses and Joshua; Elijah and Elisha and in the New Testament as the case between Jesus and His disciples. It is a lifelong process with a beginning but not an end. It is a learning programme with admission but no graduation. Interestingly, a man who is still undergoing discipleship can be given the privilege to make disciples of others whereas he also still has a discipler over him. This is unlike the common experience in apprenticeship when, an apprentice, after some years of training, does 'freedom' and starts a trade or sets up a workshop independently.

For instance, to lose sight of oneself may mean not minding the open embarrassment one face from people (whether senior or junior). So, such a man, if he is a minister of God, will not take offence if he is introduced without his title since he knows that spiritual maturity is not a function of one's earthly title but divine entitlement. Also, self denial may mean 'ignoring the desire of the flesh'. Such a man may, as a result of divine instruction, observe an impromptu vigil when his body is already demanding for a sound rest. It may equally be a pressing urge to cover one's meal at the very point of eating due to an unexpected prompting to observe a fast.

(870, 227, 'Then, shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place.','2018-10-31 10:49:50');
(871, 227, 'And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voices; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.','2018-10-31 10:50:50');
(872, 227, 'In the verse above,  the flesh is regarded as an unyielding, obstinate child that can never heed spiritual rebuke because of its eternal hostility with the spirit. So, God authorized that it should be openly stoned to death. This is a great challenge to all and sundry, requesting for a definite, decisive action because no man can serve two masters. Beloved of the Lord, have you also stoned your sinful nature to death or you are still indulging it, believing it will adjust itself to the things of God with time? How often does the flesh overcome the spirit in you in the game of choice?','2018-10-31 10:52:50');
(873, 227, 'Apart from self denial, Jesus instructed that all would-be disciples must bear their crosses daily. It is very important for us to note here that 'cross', as it is being referred to by Jesus, does not represent problem, challenge, trial or the unpleasant experience of man according to the philosophy of men. The cross in the passage connotes 'a symbol of death to flesh'. This is why certain men of understanding puts the sign of cross on the obituary of the dead. From a kingdom perspective, to bear one's cross daily implies an open announcement that the bearer is dead to flesh. It is like saying, "behold, this bearer has been called to glory in a new life with Christ and has been initiated into the eternal rest Jesus promised those who come to Him (Matt. 11:28-29). In essence, the daily carrying of cross is a constant reminder of genuine regeneration of a prospective disciple.','2018-10-31 10:53:50');
(874, 227, 'The third and final part of Jesus’ instruction in our anchor text is "... follow me". To follow Jesus means one really accepts His leadership and lordship over one's life. It depicts that one has just embarked on a journey in which Jesus takes the lead while one only follows. Little wonder, Jesus declares, "l am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (Jn. 14:16). It means there are no shortcuts to God or alternative routes. Imagine every disciple in a procession, walking through a path to a distant destination! Naturally, some of the people at the rear will personally prefer to jump the queue and overtake others before them, but the kingdom pattern is to maintain a single line, representing one fold with one shepherd in a practice of orderliness.','2018-10-31 10:54:50');
(875, 227, 'Therefore, it is expected of a true disciple to be sure that his/her leader really follows after Christ before the journey commences. Hence, Paul advises," Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."(1 Cor. 11:1). So, one may infer that Paul indirectly instructs us to withdraw from making him our model anytime we sense his digression. This is not a case of 'do as I say' but 'do as I do'. The story's told of a woman who complained about her child's idleness to her friend, whose child was reading a book just like she was doing at that time. "I wish my child can act like yours", she added. “Well, our children don't listen to our instructions. They only imitate what they see us do ", the friend remarked to the other utmost amazement of the woman.','2018-10-31 10:55:50');
(876, 228, 'After a man has undergone 'making,' he has become a disciple, he is expected to be engaged in 'making others' through the help of the Holy Spirit. However, a man that does not have this 'life' cannot give to others because no one can give others what he/she does not have. To this end, Jesus commanded the disciples: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matthew 28:19).','2018-10-31 10:56:50');
(877, 228, 'The word 'teach' used above is aimed at discipleship. If not, it would have been substituted with 'preach'. Teaching is required here because discipleship is a process just as teaching is. More importantly, teaching can be seen from two perspectives: formal and informal. These are the two wings with which discipleship can fly well. The formal is theoretical while the informal is practical. These two forms are essential to making disciples of men. An allusion to the Bible will reveal to us how Jesus applied the two for us as authentic patterns to follow. So, for effective discipleship to be achieved, we must submit ourselves to the two forms.','2018-10-31 10:57:50');
(878, 229, '1. Making disciples of others is not what anyone can jump, especially if he/she has not practically gone through genuine discipleship because life begets life. We will note that the task of raising disciples was assigned by Jesus to disciples only, not the multitude. However, this does not stop every convert from general evangelism (preaching the gospel). A similar experience can be found in a classroom setting where a well-trained student (convert) can be allowed to tutor (evangelize) other students some minor topics (basic elements of the Gospel) while only a certified teacher(disciple) can teach both minor(foundational) and major(discipleship) topics because of his/her acquired competence and proficiency. Even the disciples whom Jesus commissioned did not rush out until they were endued with power.','2018-10-31 10:58:50');
(879, 229, '2. Discipleship should not be done in a hurry and so is the making disciples of others. Both should be done systematically. We should bear in mind that it takes a complete cycle before an egg metamorphosizes through larvae to adult. So, until Christ is formed in a man, he/she cannot raise Christ-like men for God. No soup can taste sweet until it is well cooked. It is somewhat surprising to find many people who are striving to disciple others whereas they themselves are not one. Jesus, appointed the disciples first, so that they could be with Him and, second, that He might send them out to preach. So, one step precedes the other and requires adequate time.','2018-10-31 10:59:50');
(880, 230, 'A life of consecration is a life that is completely sold out to God without any restriction. Eternal consecration starts at the point of salvation and it is a lifelong contract. Eternal consecration affects every aspect of our lives and none should be left out. All on the altar and none withheld. 99.9% consecration is not enough, it is 100% or nothing. A child of God should not leave his finances on the altar but hold on to his body, a sister in the choir that has dropped her voice on the altar but finds it difficult to drop her emotions and desire is not eternally consecrated. In the same vein, a brother in the prayer subgroup that sows his time and passion into intercession but remain irresponsble in taking care of his family or gets angry at the slightest provocation. Such a life is not living with a sense of eternal consecration. ','2018-10-31 11:00:50');
(881, 230, 'This is why we must be crucified with Christ. To be crucified with Christ means that you no longer live according to the sinful lusts and desires of the flesh – you no longer commit what you know to be sin willfully and consciously. Sin in the flesh has been nailed to the cross by faith. This also means that in the practical situations of daily life, you always, without exception, say “No” whenever tempted. To agree with temptation would be the same as coming down from the cross. That is the same as constantly saying “No” to self-will. We must never allow what we like to be more important than what God wants.','2018-10-31 11:01:50');
(882, 230, 'In order to attain this level in our walk with God, we must overcome the power of the flesh. It is a common knowledge that many Christians struggle with sin. Sometimes they have victory and sometimes they fall. Yes, they do right but they also do wrong. This is very common. Nevertheless, it is NOT what God wants for His children. It is NOT how God wants us to live in this present world. He wants us to be overcomers— triumphant over sin and the flesh. ','2018-10-31 11:02:50');
(883, 230, 'The “flesh” is the rebellious nature of human beings against God’s holy commandments. It is the nature which desires to do whatever it pleases in spite of what God has commanded. The origin of this nature began with Adam and Eve, when they disobeyed God by eating the fruit of knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3). All Adam’s descendants inherited this rebellious sin nature (see Romans 5:12), including you and I. This flesh, or sin nature, is in direct opposition to the will of God and has been mankind’s problem throughout history. It is the flesh that makes people do bad things. Lies, thefts, adulteries, murder, wars, pride, wickedness, love of money, jealousy, social ills, etc all have their roots in the sin nature we inherited from our parents which they inherited from their parents, all the way back to Adam and Eve. Paul said: “I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing” (Rom. 7:18). The Scriptures declare that ‘They who are in the flesh cannot please God’ (Rom. 8:8).','2018-10-31 11:03:50');
(884, 230, 'The flesh is contrary to God’s Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is contrary to the flesh (Galatians 5:17). We often think that sin, or some specific sins, are the problems. The reality is that it’s the flesh that is the problem. Sin is just the symptom, while the flesh is the root cause. You can continue chopping off the branches of a tree but they will continue to grow later, unless you uproot the plant. You can only kill the tree at its roots. Many Christians try to deal with individual sins but they never address the underlying cause which is the uncrucified flesh. This is the rationale why every Christian must be crucified with Christ – which is like “killing” the flesh on the cross as we identify with the work of Jesus  Christ and consciously walk in this new reality','2018-10-31 11:04:50');

(895, 231, '1.	Taking eternal consecration as ‘eternal salvation’ or once saved is forever saved is an error. Eternal consecration teaches us to always check and examine ourselves if we are still in the faith not to assume that all is well when the foundation of salvation is shaky','2018-10-31 11:16:50');
(896, 231, '2.	Some people wear big cross as necklace while some always do the sign of the cross before doing anything. They think that all these are signs of being identified with the cross of Jesus makes them one with Christ. Identifying with Christ or with His crucifixion is not by physical symbols but it is a spiritual act that will be outwardly manifested in our character and lifestyle.','2018-10-31 11:17:50');
(897, 232, 'Man is a triune being – he is principally a spirit that lives in a body and has a soul. When we get born again, it is the spirit man that is regenerated; the body remains same and the soul is expected to undergo a renewal and transformation process through the help of the Holy Spirit by the word of God. A born-again Christian relates with His heavenly Father through his regenerated spirit since God is a Spirit and those that must worship Him must do so in spirit and truth (John 4:24). The relationship between the spirit man and the Holy Spirit is what gives life to our walk with God. Therefore, whenever the spirit man aligns with the Spirit of God, it is then we say we are walking in the Spirit. God will always relate with our regenerated spirit for a natural man cannot receive the things of the Spirit for they are foolishness unto him , neither can he know them for they are spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:14). To walk in the Spirit therefore means to have a relationship with the Spirit of God always; to obey Him and do His bidding. Anytime I disobey and disappoint the promptings of the flesh or sinful nature, and instead obey God, then I can say I am walking in the Spirit. Apostle Paul, responded in Galatians 5:16 that , “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh”.','2018-10-31 11:18:50');
(898, 232, 'Walking in the Spirit also means having one’s existence only in the Spirit; in other words, our survival as Christians is tied to staying put in the Spirit. This is similar to a fish that is confined to a pool of water for its survival. If it goes out of the water, it dies. The same way, if we take a step off the boundary provided by the Spirit of God for our lives, we start dying as Christians. Little wonder the Bible says, “For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live” (Romans 8:13). This is because the strength to overcome the temptations, perversion and corruption of this world resides in the Holy Spirit, and our spirit man has to be closely knitted with Him to overcome. ','2018-10-31 11:19:50');
(899, 232, 'Walking in the Spirit also means to make some spiritual advancements in terms of knowing the person of the Holy Spirit. It is not enough to live in the Spirit; we have to walk in the Spirit. The Bible says, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit” (Gal. 5:25). Living in the Spirit is totally different from Walking in the Spirit. Imagine someone living in Dubai. He stays in the beautiful city of Dubai, but has not walked the length and breadth of Dubai. He goes to work and comes back, but has never taken time to walk through the city; he does not really know Dubai but he lives there. In the same vein, so many of us are spirit-filled, tongue-talking, sealed with the Holy Spirit, but have not made some giant strides in the Spirit. To walk is to move from point A to point B. For some of us, the dimension of the Holy Spirit we knew ten years ago is what we still know; we have not discovered any newer dimensions in the Spirit because we fail to traverse, navigate, and explore the deep oceans of the bounties of the Spirit. This is a wake up  clarion call to not only live in the Spirit, but also to walk in the Spirit.','2018-10-31 11:21:50');
(900, 233, 'The word “walk” (as used in Galatians 5:16) is the Greek word “peripateo”. It means to progress, to make due use of opportunities, to regulate one’s life, to conduct oneself. This is an action word that demands us to do some work by taking a step from where we are currently. No matter where we are in the ladder of spiritual growth, it is very certain that none of us has gone through the entire length and breadth of the dimensions of the Spirit for the more we know Him, the more we want to know Him more. The book of Ezekiel gave a pictorial view of what it means to walk in the Spirit, “And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to my ankles. Again, he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to my knees. Again, he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to my waist. Again, he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed” (Ezek. 47: 3 -5). One thing that is very clear in these verses is the steady progress as Ezekiel journeyed through water of the Spirit. He yielded himself as the angel of the Lord brought him through these stages of spiritual growth (ankle, knee, waist and overflowing or too-deep experiences). Therefore, the first step we must take to walk in the Spirit is to “yield” to His influence. To yield is to surrender; to let go our will, our ego and our selfish desires. Until this happens we are not ready to walk in the Spirit. The same principle is what is applicable to people that swim. To know how to swim, you must release your body and allow it to float, before you can start swimming. In the same way, we have to release every hang over of the flesh, worldliness, every weight that slows us down so that we can become light to swim in this great river of life. There is a constant struggle going on between the flesh and the Spirit (Gal. 5:17), but God has said His Spirit will not always strive with man (Gen 6:3). So, He expects us to yield our spirit man to Him so that He can have full influence on it.','2018-10-31 11:22:50');
(901, 233, 'The second step is to stay in an atmosphere of instant obedience to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of the Lord is always speaking to us as His children, but instant obedience allows Him to lead us more into His truth. If He asks us to do something, and we refuse either by out rightly refusing or by delaying, we stand the chance of falling into the error of grieving Him. When the Spirit of God is grieved, He withdraws to Himself, and every signal of revelation and guidance is shut-down. This is a luxury we cannot afford as Christians (to live our lives without our LIFE). Therefore, prompt obedience to God’s word and promptings of the Spirit is one of the ways to walk in the Spirit. ','2018-10-31 11:24:50');
(902, 233, 'Spending quality time with the Holy Spirit through worship, studying of God’s word and praying in the Spirit is also one of the ways to walk in the Spirit. The Bible says, “be not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 8 For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life” (Gal. 6:7 -8). Beloved, how do we spend our time? This is a very critical question we must answer. Most of the time, we appear so busy, but doing what? Sowing to the flesh or sowing to the Spirit? When we use bulk of our time to watch movies that only energize and boost our fleshly desires, we tend to reduce the deposit and influence of the Spirit of God on our lives. When the Bible says we should allow the word of God to dwell richly in our hearts, this can only happen when we take time to study the word. Enough of wasting our precious time on what does not profit us eternally.','2018-10-31 11:25:50');
(903, 234, 'When we walk in the Spirit, we produce the fruits of the Spirit (This topic will be discussed in detail in our next study). This is the ultimate; this is the very reason God made man. One of the fruits of the Spirit is love. You cannot walk in the Spirit and still be walking in unforgiveness. You cannot walk in the Spirit and be sad – for joy dwells in the abode of the Spirit. Divine leading and guidance are also some of the benefits of walking in the Spirit. Freedom from sin is a major benefit of walking in the Spirit. No more guilty conscience for, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit” (Rom. 8:1). The truth is, we cannot count and quantify the inexhaustible  and boundless benefits of Walking in the Spirit as this is synonymous to living our true lives. ','2018-10-31 11:26:50');

Demonstrating the gift of healing even when the lifestyle contradicts the word of God. Since it is believed that God does not answer sinners, for the person to demonstrate the gift of healing, he must surely be walking in the Spirit.
